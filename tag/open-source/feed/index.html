										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>The release of </b><b><i>Open Pryv.io</i></b> <b>delivers a free, full production, easy-to-install open-source solution for the collection and management of sensitive personal and health data.</b></p>
<p><i>Lausanne, Switzerland, June 9</i><i>th</i><i>, 2020</i> — Today, Pryv SA, the leading Swiss provider of personal data and privacy management software announced the open-source release of <a href="https://github.com/pryv/open-pryv.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/pryv/open-pryv.io&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591767266336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE5M5Nwx5D_-qMstxXIdiLE3h7Y7w"><i>Open Pryv.io</i></a>: a free and scalable personal data lifecycle management platform specifically engineered to empower developers to rapidly create and scale breakthrough, GDPR, and privacy compliant products, services, and experiences.</p>
<p>As developer productivity has become a competitive necessity, the ready-to-use <i>Open Pryv.io</i> is marking a turning point to de-complexify the development of personal data and digital health applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/26/data-pooling-get-the-most-out-of-the-data-you-collect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/26/data-pooling-get-the-most-out-of-the-data-you-collect/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591767266336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFeNPJDzmhUKSKsjHngsGZqfSJQZw">Data pooling</a>, data aggregation, consent management, and data interoperability are among the Open Pryv.io’s capabilities that are raising the bar for delivering a reliable solution for collecting and managing heterogeneous sets of real-world personal data with full respect to privacy.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“Releasing our core software in open-source today is a natural move for us. From day one, Pryv.io was built to be open-sourced” </i>says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO and co-founder of Pryv SA<i>.</i><i> ”</i><i>In fact, our source code has always been open for our clients. </i><i>By releasing Open Pryv.io, we provide any company with a tool allowing them to address the enhanced citizen’s right, which sends a strong message of transparency and inclusivity</i><i>”.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Fostering faster innovation and less duplication of effort are also among the main drivers of Open Pryv.io’s release. Nowadays developers value using open-source instead of redeveloping available code. Integrating Pryv.io open components will allow developers to free them up to work on what is unique in their products and add privacy-by-design to their value proposition.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>Open sourcing our code is doing the right thing – for the community, for our clients, and for Pryv. We should have done it much earlier.” </i>adds Simon Goumaz, Co-Founder and Board Member at Pryv SA.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Open Pryv.io release takes place at a time when the pandemic disruption has cast a harsh light on the notion of personal data collection and privacy respect. <a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/04/20/privacy-and-health-regulation-updates-during-covid-19-must-know-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/04/20/privacy-and-health-regulation-updates-during-covid-19-must-know-updates/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591767266336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8KIT8Lzn3rmvbgTUsTeMMlh0whQ">As governments have been lifting data protection restrictions in an attempt to ease access to personal data to protect public health, the release of Open Pryv.io shows that there is a way to encourage personal data collection being done right.</a> Open Pryv.io urges to build a world where privacy is the norm &#8211; not the exception as it is today.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“Privacy doesn’t have to be only secrecy. We envision a world where privacy is the ability to share your data with awareness and control. For years now, we prove that respecting one’s privacy and having access to their data are not contradictory. The more transparent you are, the strongest relationships you will build with your users” </i>says Evelina Georgieva, Co-Founder and CBDO at Pryv SA.<i> “</i><i>No more excuses: the Open Pryv.io offers developers a strong foundation to ensure that the personal data they collect are rightfully managed from day 1.</i><i>”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Alongside this new release, which offers essential features of the <a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pryv.github.io/www/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591767266336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE-r8KgdLMHIdcEULqtCN1s2XmMsQ">Pryv.io</a> software following an open-core model, Pryv continues executing its growth strategy by licensing the enterprise-class version to projects that require high scalability, compliance documentation and dedicated support.</p>
