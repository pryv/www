<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a world awash with data, investing in personal data-fueled businesses is exponentially growing. Digital Health, Fintech, Insurtech companies that are providing behaviour-based services and solutions are just a few that are trending among them. Prior to investing, however, investors need to know that these enterprises are worth the risk. In the context of personal data-fueled businesses, this means ensuring that their portfolio companies will not hit the wall due to poor data management and misuse of the data. </span></i></p>
<h3><b>Beyond the market-product fit. Details that matter.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors focus their attention on verifying the product-market fit and rightly so. Equally they look at the power of innovation, team execution capacity and specific technology components, such as AI to unlock the data capacity. However, (excluding those specialized in </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/almost-10b-invested-in-privacy-and-security-companies-in-2019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PrivacyTech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example), verifying the scalability in managing data and privacy rightly is rarely on the top of investors’ minds.</span></p>
<p><b>Still, a company’s ability to properly manage its data can tell you a lot about its future. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while you are not expected to become the new privacy experts in town, evaluating certain data management criteria should help you ensure that these companies are managing the personal data they collect rightly, compliantly to relevant privacy regulations.</span></p>
<h3><b>Asking the right questions to get the right answers:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are only 3 Questions away to de-risk when investing in personal data-fueled businesses.</span></p>
<h4><b>Checklist:</b></h4>
<h4><b>#1 Does the company embed a privacy-first approach in the company mind-set and product design? </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflecting the situation: the GDPR, CCPA and numerous changes that are being made into existing data protection regulations are a sign that most companies still are behind when it comes to embedding privacy into their digital applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside the rising concerns around companies’ </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21353232/twitter-ftc-fine-misused-email-phone-advertising-2011-settlement"><span style="font-weight: 400;">misuse of the data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the current shift in users’ tolerance with regard to the disrespect for their privacy needs to be addressed. In a &#8220;user-first&#8221; world, lacking trust results in poor business offerings, limited access and less data sharing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No valuable data for a data-fueled business means </span><b>no return in investment for an investor.</b></p>
<h4><b>#2 Does the company master its personal data lifecycle: from collection, structure, storage, sharing and deletion?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mastering <a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/27/data-lifecyle-management/">the personal data lifecycle</a> is what allows companies to have a proper oversight of what is happening within their organization in terms of data. For a data-driven enterprise, this is today an absolute necessity; first in regard to compliance, but also for everything else:</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does the organization precisely understand what EXACT VALUE the collected data already brings to the organization so that they can build an efficient data monetization strategy?</span></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does their system have interoperability capabilities to allow easy integration and manage diverse data-sets? Can it SCALE over time?</span></i></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do they properly address all the current regulatory requirements? Are they ready to ADAPT to forthcoming changes?</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before investing, be sure to ask your prospective companies these few questions to ensure that they master how the personal data they collect is managed throughout their organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, it is a good indicator that they are ready to scale overtime and thrive in </span><a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/the-rise-of-the-privacytechs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the “Techs”-era</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h4><b>#3 Does their technology allow for privacy-preserving globalization?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, legal interoperability is nothing less but a necessity to scale up any data-driven business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet with the multiplication of privacy laws and related obligations as regards to <a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/08/03/data-residency-insights-on-where-to-store-the-personal-data-you-collect/">data residency</a>, growth in user base and new partnerships that imply for the data to be transferred somewhere new are only a few among the multiple scenarios that make it particularly difficult for a data privacy unconscious business to adapt afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A privacy-preserving globalization approach will help ensure that<a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/23/consent/"> business growth opportunities won’t turn into an issue, but a success.</a></span></p>
<h3><b>Why is privacy important ?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, privacy is not about compliance only. Privacy is about data ethics, business values, and how much trust you can put into a company that collects and processes personal data.</span></p>
<h3><b>Investment is(n’t) blind.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like in love, a long-lasting relationship does not rely on first-sight, but trust. As you probably wouldn&#8217;t marry someone that you don’t trust, we bet you wouldn’t want to invest in a business you have doubts about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same logic, when investing in a data-fueled business, better ask yourself before moving further: Would you be the one to trust this business with your family personal data?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope the checklist above will help you make the right choices for profitable investments.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you consider investing in a technology which does scale across industries and regulations?</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Open banking: Whereas initially seen as a way to enable exchanges between financial institutions, it is now spreading faster and even beyond expectations.</strong></p>
<p><b><i>Once upon a time </i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">we</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">used to think of banking as private safes and white collars. Today, it is certainly one of the most promising areas for data-driven innovation. Each time a user pays online, it leaves behind a digital trail of information, allowing for infinite data-fueled possibilities. Yet just like banknotes, personal financial data needs to be kept safely. This means in this case: in compliance with the GDPR, Swiss DPA or any other relevant data protection regulation.</span></i><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Open Banking: Mastering privacy &amp; consent  </b><b>to unlock the personal data superpower</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth of personal data usage is exponential and affects almost any industry. On one side of this growth, there are the users who keep calling for more on-click personalised offerings and &#8220;fluidity&#8221; of data transfer. On the other, businesses that are striving to deliver on these demands in the best possible way. Some of these businesses, however, are just kicking off in the personal data economy services accessing. This has been core for the banks and financial industries.</span></p>
<p><b>Banks online &amp; payments: guardians of trust</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pandemic casted a harsh light on the notion of personal data collection and privacy respect, it also further strengthened the boost towards contactless and online paying services. Unlike other industries operating with personal data, the banking industry is fortunate to be one step ahead when it comes to trust: </span><a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2019/03/18/distrust-personal-data-protection/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">people trust banks and other financial entities to safeguard their personal data more than other organizations.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Perhaps for this reason, digital banks and mobile financial applications have been growing like weeds in the past few years; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">trust being the “magic” seed of their super-fast expansion.</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://g.co/kgs/ghN9eF"><b>« Bank 4.0: banking everywhere. Never at a bank »</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As banking services are being digitized, paying cash is becoming a thing of the past. Twint, Revolut and other “one-click” solutions are becoming the new way to pay for anything, anywhere. And online banking apps are the new go-to for managing bank accounts anytime, “stay home”-compliant and safe. So, if banks were long seen as closed physical places with thick walls and locked doors, they are now becoming prime actors of the rising personal data economy. A rise reinforced by the recent introduction of </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-banking.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Banking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a practice that provides third-party service providers open access to consumer banking transactions and financial data through the use of application programming interfaces (APIs).</span></p>
<p><b>Open Banking Poker Face: Superhero or Supervillain?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open banking introduces a new paradigm that opens up many business opportunities. Whereas initially seen as a way to enable exchanges between financial institutions, it is now spreading faster and even beyond expectations. Unforeseen personal data offerings in a cross-industry corporation arise indeed when personal and financial data is derived and aggregated. And in a world where everything can be bought a click away, derived applications are endless. </span></p>
<p><b>Applications, “Sur-mesure”.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just to mention a few, service providers already suggest personalized offerings based on correlating financial and personal data, like targeted budgets for monthly shopping, savings and loans. Thanks to the data collected through open banking, the app can be made perfect for any user: depending on the stage of your life whether you are a student, a parent, buying property or planning retirement, it will provide you with an offer which suits you best.</span></p>
<p><b>Privacy-first (un)locks Open Banking</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, if Open banking is great for business, it is also referred to as a </span><a href="https://www.paymentssource.com/opinion/open-banking-can-be-a-privacy-nightmare"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nightmare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it comes to privacy. Especially, the system raises questions as regards to the privacy of the users whose data is being shared: do they understand what their data is being used for? Are they given the opportunity to give explicit consent as required by the GDPR? To ensure that open banking will benefit the users and not foster discrimination, strong safeguards have to be put in place.</span></p>
<p><b>Solution: Beyond secrecy, use Pryv.io personal data and consent management solution to enhance your users privacy.</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Personal data aggregation, sharing and processing should be as effective, secure and trustworthy as online banking.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one could argue that not sharing any data would be the best solution to ensure users privacy, we beg to disagree: Privacy doesn’t have to be only secrecy. At Pryv, we envision a world where privacy is the ability to share personal data with awareness, trust and control.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Giving explicit consent to collect and share personal data has per core requirement that users understand which data we are talking about. Trust comes with the ability to check the content of these data and the exchanges between all parties. Like banks that provide detailed reports of all transactions in time, classified in bank accounts” &#8211; Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO of Pryv</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/23/consent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhancing trust requires rethinking consent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In this new paradigm, privacy is not a compliance tick box but an opportunity to break data silos, differentiate products and services, and attract end-users with trust, transparency and empowerment.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pryv.io data model provides all data in &#8220;time series&#8221; contextualised and classified in streams. It is designed to provide the same readability and transparency as your bank report. So anyone could make decisions and check its execution with a minimum of effort.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beat the &#8220;get-user-consent&#8221; fear: start managing your users&#8217; data exactly as the bank manages your money!
