<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io Personal Data Mapping to enable automatic integration with existing warehouses.</span></p>

<h2><b>Integrate existing data warehouses with Pryv.io privacy back-end:</b></h2>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make legacy systems (warehouses) easy to integrate with new external systems within a privacy-compliant environment. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Significantly reduce time and errors managing data-subject requests.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv developed and commercialized a privacy-by-design middleware system that provides fu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ll, innovative personal data</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> life cycle management. This technology allows for privacy compliance, interoperability and data sharing to a granular-level, using transparent, unambiguous enforcement of consent applied on a data set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io Data Mapping provides companies with existing data warehouses the means to adopt faster innovation, integrate real-world personal data and build better personalised services, all within a transparent and privacy-compliant environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing systems usually face major hurdles integrating with external solutions with the synchronisation of very big datasets and the transfer and storage of multiple copies of sensitive data. Pryv.io Data Mapping allows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to benefit from the capacity of privacy-by-design models;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">map dynamically existing datasets in a transparent and unambiguous form, presented to an individual for his enlightened consent;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unlock the capacity to offer privacy on legacy datasets.  </span></li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Current status for managing data-subject requests on personal data access </b><b>and processing by systems without privacy-by-design architecture:</b></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, initiating a NEW data processing in organizations with legacy systems involves time consuming processing for the Data Protection Officer (DPO) to scope the necessary datasets, collect consents and verify compliance with applicable regulations. Furthermore, it requires manual intervention of technicians to extract datasets. Multi-employees interaction and manual processes are prolonged, lack efficiency and generate errors. Such processes would not be acceptable in the short-mid term. Investments in innovation and automation must be considered. (Pic. 1)</span></p>

<h2><b>Managing data-subject requests on personal data access and processing by </b><b>implementing Privacy-by-design solutions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy-by-design solutions digitalize consent collection and offer effective control over the personal data life cycle. Pryv.io provides a privacy-by-design framework to interact with personal data. This framework only operates on data it controls. (Pic.2)</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, this solution requires the data to be fully copied and synchronized from/with the legacy system. This process is not optimal for large data warehouses, data lakes and highly dyn</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">amic data sets.</span></p>

<p><b>Solution: Personal Data Mapping to enable automatic integration with </b><b>existing warehouse for managing data-subject requests on personal data </b><b>access and processing</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet the needs of mapping large data warehouses, data lakes and highly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dynamic data sets, Pryv has developed a new technology that maps dynamically </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing datasets in a transparent and unambiguous form to be presented to an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">individual for his enlightened consent.  </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unlocking the capacity to offer privacy on legacy datasets allows us to provide our services to a much broader set of companies handling personal data, which is important since the older ones are more in need of an up-to-date system regarding privacy regulations.” says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO and co-founder of Pryv SA.</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy-by-design solutions digitalize consent collection and offer effective </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">control over personal data life cycle. <a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/data_in_pryv/">Pryv.io</a> provides a privacy-by-design </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">framework to interact with personal data. To operate, this framework must s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tand as a &#8220;gateway&#8221; to interact with personal data</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including Dynamic Mapping. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Existing Datasets allows to benefit from privacy by design for new over </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing data sets.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether intentionally or not, when data integrity has been compromised, it can not only result in serious risks for the data subjects concerned, but also make the company appear untrustworthy.  Data with compromised integrity can not only create risks for the data subject itself, but also position the entire company’s reputation and operations at risk.</span></i></p>
<p><b>Once lost, trust cannot be easily found, or not at all.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data tampering attacks are a serious threat. And as recent news indicates an upsurge of cyber-attacks against personal data-fueled businesses worldwide, one that should be taken seriously. Imagine the repercussions of a clinical trial results based on data altered by an attacker.</span></p>
<p><b>Data can be tampered with in many ways.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the worst cases, these alterations may even remain undetected. So how can you ensure that data has not been subject to unauthorized changes along the way?</span></p>
<p><b>Data Integrity</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data integrity refers to the accuracy and consistency (validity) of data over the </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/27/data-lifecyle-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data lifecycle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It means that the data, from the time it was collected to the time it was stored, used, shared, archived and deleted, can be trusted to be accurate and free from tampering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulations such as the </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/12/11/gdpr-checklist-pryv/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1962_1962_1962/en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiss DPA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in particular provide for such a requirement as a key principle to ensure that data is adequately protected, which is of utmost importance when it comes to the collection and usage of personal data assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By ensuring data integrity, companies ensure that data is exactly as it should be at any given time, which is key for health data, medical information, or contractual documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (eg.: with a digital signature (</span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/06/04/econsent-management-for-remote-and-decentralized-clinical-trials/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eConsent)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Clinical Trials DCT), etc)</span></p>
<p><b>How is Data Integrity achieved by Pryv.io? &#8211; Generating a checksum for all data uploaded</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a document or information is created or modified on Pryv.io, a receipt is issued with a “</span><b>checksum</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, which can then be used to detect unexpected  modification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The receipt does not expose any personal data, but simply serves as proof of integrity. You can think of this receipt (checksum) as your data’s fingerprint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ability to check for data accuracy and consistency can be very valuable in the context of Remote Clinical Trials.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">For example: Tom, a participant of the trial, uploads a document on a dedicated online platform to be shared with Dr.Jones, his investigator:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the upload is completed, a receipt is issued to Tom with the following checksum: “1582054665”.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom can share the receipt (checksum) with Bob separately. And tell Bob that the document he will get must have the same checksum (“1582054665”). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, Bob could compute the checksum when he receives the document and send it to Dr.Jones, who can then confirm that the “fingerprints” match. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a single bit of the document is changed, the checksum will be fully different. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>What added value does it bring?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether on purpose or by accident, compromising data integrity can not only result in serious risks for the data subjects, but also put the entire company’s reputation and operations at risk. At any given time, individuals using a platform, or an app built on Pryv.io can verify that the data has not been subject to any unauthorized change.</span></p>
<p><b>Data Audit &amp; Integrity?</b></p>
<p><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/25/audit-logs-in-pryv-io-when-every-single-piece-of-information-matters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audit logs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> maintain a full and complete history of every change that has been made on a piece of data, by whom and when. An audit log is the simplest, yet also one of the most effective forms of tracking temporal information. Any time something significant happens, a record indicating what happened and when it happened, is generated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coupled with this audit feature and versioning of Pryv.io, companies can rebuild the data lifecycle to prove the genuinity of the data.</span></p>
<p><b>Blockchain &#8211; Full data integrity support for Pryv.io enables a new level of trust and confidence between our customers and their partners</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pryv.io data integrity mechanism is designed to be coupled with a timestamping solution or a blockchain. In that case, the blockchain would keep all the receipts for public (or private) consultation. </span></p>
<p><b>Data worths nothing if not trustworthy</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Pryv we continuously work on advancing Pryv.io functionalities to ensure we deliver an outstanding technology not only to meet technical and legal requirements, to ensure confidentiality and trustworthiness of data, but embed trust in any aspect of building a strong relationship with your customers. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Master the GDPR Compliance Checklist with Pryv.io</em></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not news: from two years already, if you’re a company operating with EU citizens personal data, you have to comply with the </span></i><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2019/11/20/gdpr-swiss-dpa-e-privacy/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (General Data Protection Regulation). Effective since 25 May 2018, the regulation sets out a number of legal obligations to be met in terms of privacy requirements and generous fines to be paid for those who don’t play by its rules. Yet in spite of its not-so newness, a lot of questions are still arising when it comes to GDPR compliance: how to achieve it? Where to start? How to leverage its requirements into a competitive advantage?</span></i></p>
<p><b> Master the GDPR Compliance Checklist with Pryv</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While lots of companies see the GDPR as a boring legal conundrum to solve, it is actually one of the best frameworks you can use to flourish and scale up your business. That is of course, assuming you do it smartly; we bet you would rather use your resources to enhance your application than have them stuck finding a way to answer on the user&#8217;s rights on their data: how to execute their consent, where to store their data&#8230; getting a copy of the data ready, process to delete it? At the end of this article, you’ll be the one ready to master your GDPR compliance and know how Pryv.io’s capabilities can help you thrive in the blooming personal data economy.</span></p>
<p><b>GDPR 101: a checklist to achieve compliance</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make it easier for companies to navigate the storm of the GDPR data protection and privacy requirements, the </span><a href="https://gdpr.eu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gdpr.eu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website provides easy-to-understand, compliance guidance through a variety of digital content aiming at explaining and/or highlighting the specifics of the regulation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Especially, they provide a free, online </span><a href="https://gdpr.eu/checklist"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR Compliance Checklist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that businesses can use as a framework to achieve their own compliance. </span><b>This is exactly where you want to start when asking: &#8220;Am I ready for the GDPR?&#8221;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divided in four parts, the checklist sets out a list of 19 things to be checked or done (preferably before going to market!) in order to reduce the risks of regulatory penalties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The checkups are regrouped by privacy-related “themes”:</span></p>

<p><b>GDPR Compliance Checklist @ glance, with Pryv</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io is an extensible personal data life-cycle </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/27/data-lifecyle-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">management platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specifically engineered </span><b>to empower businesses </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">to rapidly create and scale breakthrough, GDPR compliant applications.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of organizations are skeptical about involving a third-party for their privacy</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; we get it.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let’s be clear: we don’t access or host any data. All we do is to provide our clients with a ready-to-use, scalable piece of code/software that can be used to rightfully collect, store, share and use personal data. Moreover, you can even choose where you want the data to be stored for each user separately, so it is both safe and compliant with all relevant data residency laws. Pryv.io will then be deployed on the servers and/or infrastructure of your choice. </span></i></p>

</td>
<td style="height: 456px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This part is about ensuring that the personal data you collect will be safe, secured and well protected. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As said before, we do not access or host any data. Using Pryv.io will thus not jeopardize your internal security; at best, it can also help you achieve it. Our software is privacy-by-design and provides encryption for data &#8220;at move&#8221; (during transmission). For data at rest: Pryv.io supports client-side mechanisms so you can add as many security layers as you need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io&#8217;s segmentation of data and aliasing feature (Release Q1 2021) also allows to selectively share data pseudonymized or anonymised if there is no data that allows identification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Pryv.io’s audit module provides information to security systems that can be used to detect a data breach, and further help you identify which data has been leaked.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it is your job to ensure that your customers can enact their rights, on our side, we provide you with the functionalities to execute them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Built with a user-centric approach, Pryv is designed to ensure these functionalities while maximizing software performance and business efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Pryv.io allows you to provide your users with the option to backup their data on their computer or transfer it to another company (data portability, as requested by checkup #17).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(For example, we developed a ”</span><a href="https://bluebutton.pryv.me/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blue button</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” app, which will allow the data to be exported as JSON files and packed inside a password protected zip file in one click.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Our </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/reference/#update-event"><span style="font-weight: 400;">API methods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allow our customers to easily correct/update/delete data inside a user’s account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Pryv.io proposes a specific mode that enables isolation of per-user data in back-ups for deletion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our software is privacy-by-default (default opt-out). This is made to ensure that your users have an explicit choice as to accept or object to the processing of their data. All processes have a 1-to-1 relationship with the users of the App, allowing them to update or revoke their consent at all times. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is dynamic consent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a plus: you can further de-risk your compliance with the Pryv.io </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/25/audit-logs-in-pryv-io-when-every-single-piece-of-information-matters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data-audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> embedded feature &#8211; so that beyond allowing your users to benefit from their lawful rights, you can also prove that they were respected and executed rightly.</span></td>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b><i>The Data LifeCycl</i></b><b>e</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refers to the sequence of stages a specific unit of data undergoes within an organization: from the time it was generated or collected, to the time it was stored, used, shared, archived and deleted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies tend to put their best resources and minds on getting the best product for their users &#8211; it&#8217;s normal. But in doing so, a number of organizations are failing at organizing their data lifecycle. First, it is not a simple task: it’s a blend of legal, IT and business-logic actions which need to be designed to meet current data and regulatory requirements, as well as to last over time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, very often, while focusing too much on the data processing stage, organizations forget about the importance of carefully managing the data at all of its stages, which can rapidly become an issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data without proper management can not only create privacy and security gaps, but also position the entire operations of the company at risk. Not to mention the fact that you would probably get more insights from the data once you&#8217;ll have a clear picture of your company’s entire data economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, having a proper oversight of the data lifecycle stages and how to implement them within your organization is absolutely essential: not only to achieve business efficiency and properly address all relevant privacy and data protection requirements, but also to ensure seamless interoperability and scalability.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does your system have interoperability capabilities to allow easy integration and manage diverse data-sets? Can it scale over time?</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does your system properly address all the current regulatory requirements? Are you ready to adapt to forthcoming changes?</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your company prepared to efficiently handle users’ data requests: “where is my data? Who does access it? Can you delete it?”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you prove that you have executed your users’ rights and consent correctly?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Pryv, we made it our core business to answer these critical questions, and made available for businesses a ready-to-use solution to manage personal data, rightly. </span></p>
<h3><b>Meet Pryv.io:</b> <b>Simple, yet remarkably powerful personal data management platform. </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io is an extensible personal data lifecycle management platform specifically engineered </span><b>to empower businesses </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">to rapidly create and scale breakthrough, privacy compliant products.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its data model is precisely designed to aggregate and distribute multiple sources of information. </span><a href="http://pryv.github.io"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The API</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows you to easily collect and store any type of personal data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dynamic consent and auditing capabilities ensure that beyond allowing your users to benefit from their lawful rights, you can prove that they were respected and executed rightly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralized and per-user data storage distribution are also included as must-have features to guarantee your business scalability across legal environments.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on your core business knowledge and let pryv.io optimize your organization’s resources for a responsible, efficient, and lawful collection, use, sharing and disposal of information.</span></p>
<h4><b>(1) Data Collection: </b><b>Seamless connectivity, interoperability with no-limits.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io allows you to collect data from any source of information, including, but not limited to: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet of things (IoT) devices </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile applications</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Server-side data collection for web-enabled applications</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any other source</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It further supports collecting, aggregating and storing data, such as: files, health metrics, locations, audio samples, notes, pictures, activities… you name it! So that you can collect any type of data you need to fulfill the purpose of your organization &#8211; today, tomorrow, and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we already implemented a various number of </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/event-types/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standard Types</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the data, our customers are allowed to design their own data models and implement it under Pryv&#8217;s conventions if needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To know more about how Pryv.io allows you to collect and aggregate data from multiple sources for a subject, you can take a peek at our </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/guides/data-modelling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Modelling Guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which further explains Pryv’s Data collection.</span></p>
<p><b>Pryv.io High Frequency:</b><b> unleashing IoT Connectivity with High Throughput Data Ingestion.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case data is collected by IoT devices, Pryv goes even deeper and </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2018/03/22/pryv-unleashes-iot-connectivity-with-high-throughput-data-ingestion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unleashes IoT Connectivity with High Throughput Data Ingestion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ingesting data at almost any speed your underlying system allows, making storing data at high frequency a breeze for your organization.</span></p>
<h4><b>(2) Data Aggregation and Structure:</b><b> All data is kept per-user, total control over privacy</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The value of combining a robust amount of data and diverse datasets is essential for providing personalized offerings. We understand that and offer you a way to do it efficiently, compliantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inherently, all data is collected at a specific moment in time. We thus designed a data structure that approaches all collected data as &#8220;time-stamped data&#8221;, providing companies with an interoperable structure that is easy to understand and work with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This extendable and scalable solution allows for unlimited types of data to be structured in a unified model and organized hierarchically, enabling the data to bring meaningful insights to organizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on “streams” and “events”, pryv.io provides a unique ontology (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv SA know-how and trade secret, labelled as fully “Swiss made” technology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) that allows for interoperable structure designed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to serve Privacy and Development Teams.</span></p>
<p><b>Pryv.io Data Model: </b><b>Data structures for interoperability</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To let data be easily understood and exchanged across systems, we provide an open directory of standard types, which we recommend developers use when interoperability is a concern </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/data_in_pryv/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(read more</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<h4><b>(3) Data Storage: </b><b>Decentralized design to span the globe with no bottleneck.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations should always know what data they are collecting, who can access it, and who will effectively access it before making any decision about where the data should live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Pryv.io, you can easily store data into a distributed environment to enable local (on- premise/per choice) Regulations Compliance, and even create installations that span the globe and co-locate the data with the users’ legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on a powerful distributed model, users are distributed among servers with no global bottleneck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each user account can be served by a different server, which can be located anywhere. The capabilities are set by the architectures in terms of bandwidth and storage. The architecture is designed according to the client’s needs.</span></p>
<h4><b>(4) Data Sharing: </b><b>Dynamic Consent and Protected Access.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A clear sharing mechanism allows giving access to selected pieces of data to anyone, while still retaining full control over the data. Pryv.io enables you to define accesses with different levels of permissions for third-parties to interact with your data, or only particular folders of your data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through a sleek “campaign manager”, it manages access permissions of multiple accounts, making storing accesses of multiple data subjects that gave you their consent easier. The perfect solution to be able to retrieve all data accesses and facilitate data aggregation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about Pryv Consent Aggregation on our dedicated </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/guides/data-modelling/#consent-aggregation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">web page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h4><b>(5) Data Audit: </b><b>Transparency at a glance.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io provides access to audit logs and pre-built compliance services. The Audit logs keep track of details about the actions performed by clients against Pryv.io accounts through the Pryv.io API. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A full audit trail documenting interaction with the data is embedded in the solution: who does create the data-point, when and under what granularity a consent is given. A proof that any access is authorized is provided  by listing all the processes applicable under GDPR, such as: who did access and review the data and when.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io facilitates compliance with existing and future data protection and privacy regulations on a global scale.</span></p>
<h4><b>(6) Data Retrieval: </b><b>protected backups for your users.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io allows you to provide your users with the option to backup their data on their computer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, we developed a ”blue button” app, which will allow the data to be exported as JSON files and packed inside a password protected zip in one click.</span></p>
<h4><b>(7) Data Deletion: </b><b>Data erasure on demand &#8211; proven and safe.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest issues with the data collection is that very rarely it is made clear for how long the data will be stored before being deleted. Only a few businesses provide their users the option to use the “download” and “delete” buttons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io proposes a specific mode that enables isolation of per-user data in back-ups for deletion.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard Business Review </span></i><a href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">called</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “data scientist the sexiest job of the 21st century”. Unlocking data value inspires you to look forward to finding out more. Dissecting data is what makes your business services worth; allowing you to bring value to your customers and to stay competitive. The more you collect, the better. But is it really about data collection?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flip the coin and you’ll see that the true potential of the data that you collect lies in its aggregation. Your data scientists will only be able to unlock its value when identifying rich data sources, aggregating them with others, and pooling large quantities of formless data.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Pryv.io, we enable you to pool and analyze data meaningfully.</span></p>
<h3><b>Data pooling enables you to combine data sets coming from different sources. </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let your Data Scientists Deep Dive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">data scientists need data. A lot of it. They can only make discoveries while swimming in deep data pools. Let them deep-dive &#8211; ensure that their swimming pool is deep enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to do so?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s assume that you aim at developing a Digital Health platform, fed with aggregated personal data. So data pooling means that you can:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">combine together data on one individual coming from multiple sources such as medical devices, specialist clinics, health records.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">merge into one file multiple datasets from many patients coming from various countries or institutions. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both cases, this is what makes the data pool deeper and generates value for your data scientists. </span></p>
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6415" src="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling-600x450.png" alt="Data Pooling By Pryv" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling-600x450.png 600w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling-1024x768.png 1024w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling-768x576.png 768w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling.png 1912w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wait is over: the icing on the cake.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you know why data pooling is indispensable to get valuable insight from data that you collect. </span><b>Unlock your business value by ensuring that your data scientists are provided with enough data at a glance.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best is yet to come- the Icing on the cake : Pryv.io does it for you. From data collection to data aggregation, data structure and understanding, Pryv enables you to get the most out of the data you collect. Let’s walk through an example to illustrate where Pryv.io stands and how we can help you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s often that you are collecting data from different sources and that you need to share the whole or only part of the aggregated dataset with various third parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let’s go through a basic use case, in which you are conducting a clinical trial involving hundreds of patients from different institutions. You are researching the impact of allergen exposure and nutrition diet on the sleep behavior of patients, and you’re having three different teams analyzing the collected data from different perspectives :</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team A needs to analyze personal information from every patient (such as age, gender, ethnicity, etc);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team B is combining allergen exposure with sleep data to identify patterns;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team C is looking at the relationship between nutrition and sleep.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already getting a headache just thinking about how to structure your data efficiently to aggregate it and share only what each of the teams need?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io enables you to aggregate data from multiple sources and to share only what is needed.</span></p>
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6417" src="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/teams-600x444.png" alt="Data Pooling By Pryv" width="600" height="444" srcset="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/teams-600x444.png 600w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/teams-1024x758.png 1024w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/teams-768x569.png 768w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/teams-1536x1138.png 1536w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/teams.png 1912w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />
<h3><b>Pryv.io has developed a tool that solves it all for you. Our aggregator allows you to pool data from multiple sources at once, and to create appropriate and up-to-date datasets with data across multiple accounts for each team to work on.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How is that?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io aggregator enables you to collect and aggregate any type of data from all your patients. Data from a smartphone, a smartwatch, a health record, any source of data, all in one place.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our data model in “streams” and “events” structures your data, and allows your patients to grant your app/or your team access to the needed streams. (</span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/12/pryv-helps-you-collect-personal-data-rightfully/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more on that in this article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each patient’s data subset gets aggregated into your own database and the appropriate datasets are exposed to your teams and your algorithms/apps.</span></li>
</ul>
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6416" src="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/multiple_devices-600x445.png" alt="Data Pooling By Pryv" width="600" height="445" srcset="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/multiple_devices-600x445.png 600w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/multiple_devices-1024x760.png 1024w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/multiple_devices-768x570.png 768w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/multiple_devices-1536x1140.png 1536w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/multiple_devices.png 1908w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />

<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once datasets are allocated to each team by sharing the appropriate subsets of streams, they get automatically updated. It means that as soon as new data from any patient is collected, a webhook notifies the server that fetches the data and updates the dataset for the concerned team (more on webhooks in Pryv.io </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/27/webhooks-at-pryv-io-when-data-ages-in-milliseconds-waiting-is-not-an-option/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6414" src="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling_loop-600x448.png" alt="Data Pooling By Pryv" width="600" height="448" srcset="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling_loop-600x448.png 600w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling_loop-1024x764.png 1024w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling_loop-768x573.png 768w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling_loop-1536x1146.png 1536w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling_loop.png 1916w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All at once, you can now collect and aggregate data coming from different sources for one to thousands of patients, and create multiple data pools </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">so that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">your data scientists </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can work more efficiently and get the most out of your collected data</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All of that while respecting the data privacy of your patients, and ensuring a trusting relationship.</span></p>
<p><strong>It’s as simple as that, so you have one less thing to worry about and one more to benefit from: <a href="https://pryv.github.io/www">Pryv.io</a>.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing vast amounts of personal data has become “the new normal”, many would think. Wrong! Regulations race to implement adequate measures to protect personal data. Proving compliance is an increasingly pressing topic for any IT development team of a mobile (app) solution, based on personal data aggregation. Privacy-compliance is the new normal. Developing an effective privacy-preserving data management solution is imperative. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will show you the power of using Pryv.io data-audit to de-risk your compliance. </span></i></p>
<h2><b>So what are audit logs?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audit logs maintain a full and complete history of every change that has been made on a piece of data, by whom and when. An audit log is the simplest, yet also one of the most effective forms of tracking temporal information. Any time something significant happens, a record indicating what happened and when it happened, is generated.</span></p>
<h2><b>What do data audits look like? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can take many physical forms, but the most common form is a file. It must contain all relevant information concerning the sequence of activities that affected at any time a specific operation, procedure, or event in an IT system. In addition to documenting what resources were accessed, audit log entries usually include destination and source addresses, a timestamp and user login information.</span></p>
<h2><b>Why do you need to use data-audits? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stringent data protection regulations become a major concern to organizations. Bolstering your data management capabilities to meet compliance is a priority and business-critical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond being a good practice, using data-audits will not only allow you to keep logs of any data interactions but also to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“demonstrate compliance</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, which is a key point of the GDPR.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, audit logs have taken on new importance for cybersecurity and are often the basis for diagnostic performance, error correction and security analysis.</span></p>
<h2><b>De-risk your compliance with data-audit at Pryv.io</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audit logs keep track of details about the actions performed by your app users against Pryv.io accounts through the Pryv.io API. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, it describes the source (the identifier for the action that generated this log), the type of log, the time when it was executed, the audited action (typically the API method call), the identifier for the access used to perform the audited action, and the HTTP response status resulting from the audited action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is an example of a single audit log in Pryv.io : </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-6378" src="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-04-at-10.16.17-600x274.png" alt="Audit logs Pryv" width="485" height="221" srcset="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-04-at-10.16.17-600x274.png 600w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-04-at-10.16.17-768x351.png 768w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-04-at-10.16.17.png 788w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can see that the IP address “172.18.0.7” was used to get the events from the stream “Diary” at the time 1261988300 seconds, and that the attempt was unsuccessful as the used access has expired, all of this at one glance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audit logging is an essential ingredient for your infrastructure. By using the capabilities of Pryv.io log management system, you are a step closer in succeeding your compliance auditing. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Managing Personal Data Rightfully from The First Time and Overtime</strong></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, collecting personal data is made easy, many would say. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">While collecting data can be easy, getting valuable insights from it is certainly not. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more, managing it properly so that you win your users&#8217; trust and stay on top of the regulations is the hard job to do.</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if you could spend less time worrying about how to manage personal data?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if you could use this time to increase your users’ trust and engagement?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if you could focus on your own benefits and return on your data investments?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Pryv.io, we enable you to manage personal data rightfully &#8211; from the first time and overtime.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter the existing and upcoming regulations on data protection, our software allows you to remain compliant at all times and to build a trustful relationship with your users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how does it work? Let’s walk through a basic use case to see how Pryv.io solves data privacy challenges.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collecting personal data in real-time allows you to gain valuable insights quickly and to make decisions accordingly. </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s say that you have built an algorithm that computes allergen exposure based on geolocation data and displays it on your app to users and their doctors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This involves three types of actors : </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your app users;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your algorithm, that processes the geolocation data of the users and computes the allergen exposure;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctors, who consult the allergen exposure data and provide feedback to the app users.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your algorithm takes the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">personal geolocation data, processes it, outputs the allergen exposure and shares it with the user (patient) and doctors on the digital app at any time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy? Well, sounds easy enough to collect personal data until you need to prove that you have the right to collect it and handle data privacy correctly.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The geolocation of your user is a personal, sensitive data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your user has the right to revoke his consent and to decline sharing this sensitive data with any other third-parties (such as doctors, in this use case). </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, your user really wants to use your app to help him and to be guided by his doctor about his allergen exposure. Is this possible? We made a simple way to do it. </span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensitive Personal Data Sharing, Simplified.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only the algorithm needs to see the geolocation data, and nobody else, so why not just restrain the read access of the geolocation data to the algorithm?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And restrain the allergens data to the user and his doctor?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And oh, what if his doctor wants to communicate his feedback to the user?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starts to get a bit more complex, mmh ?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s draw it simply in “streams” and display the data using </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/data_in_pryv/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv Data Model</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> :</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6401" src="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_model_structure-600x453.png" alt="Pryv Data Model Allergens" width="600" height="453" srcset="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_model_structure-600x453.png 600w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_model_structure-1024x774.png 1024w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_model_structure-768x580.png 768w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_model_structure-1536x1160.png 1536w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_model_structure.png 1652w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When structuring the data in “streams” (which act like folders on your computer), you will be adding “events”, corresponding to time-stamped data in the related stream, and managing the level of “access” to this stream (‘read’, ‘manage’, ‘contribute’ or ‘create-only’).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the stream “Position” will only contain events of type “position/wgs84”, whereas the stream “Allergens” will contain substreams of allergens (“Pollen”, “Cereal crops”, etc) with events of type &#8220;density/kg-m3&#8221; …</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you see how our data model in streams and events is helpful. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has never been that easy to take and share only a piece of data, with different levels of access.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For your app, it means that: first, the data is collected, aggregated from different sources and structured in the right way in Pryv.io. Then, it enables your app users to decide </span><b>what</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they want to share and </span><b>with whom, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and to revoke that access at any time</span><b>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And finally, it gives you peace of mind for any data privacy regulations, as all the requirements to meet are already designed in Pryv.io. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an app user, you decide if you :</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">want the algorithm only to be able to see your geolocation? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share the stream “Position” with a “read” level.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">want your doctor to see your allergen exposure? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share the stream “Allergens” with a “read” level.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">want your doctor to give you feedback and advice? Share the stream “Doctor’s feedback” with a “manage” level, enabling the doctor to add his comments in newly created child streams of this stream.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can be all automated by creating access requests from your app. It will send a notification to your user to request access to the stream  “Position” stream on a “read” level and to “Allergens” on a “manage” level.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-6405 aligncenter" src="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-04-at-13.47.53.png" alt="Pryv example Data Allergens" width="199" height="316" /></span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a Trustful Relationship with Your Users, made easy.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By structuring the data you collect in this way and sharing the data of your user at a very granular level only to authorized third-parties with the user’s explicit consent, you establish a trustful relationship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more trust your users have in your app, the more data they will share.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the data your users are willing to share, you will be able to adapt the user interfaces to the different third-parties and display only authorized data.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respecting your user’s privacy will make your users more prone to share personal information with you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the more data you will get, the more you will be able to provide valuable insights for your customer.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6404" src="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/value_loop-600x448.png" alt="Pryv values usecase allergens" width="600" height="448" srcset="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/value_loop-600x448.png 600w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/value_loop-1024x764.png 1024w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/value_loop-768x573.png 768w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/value_loop-1536x1146.png 1536w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/value_loop.png 1608w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Pryv.io notifies your app of any data changes from now.</strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast world, fast life- technology made the world change in milliseconds. Every second, a new piece of personal information is born. It begins its long journey in this digital world from being created, updated, acknowledged &#8230; leaving digital footprints with the purpose to be transferred into valuable insight to someone. Regulators made it clear, as owners of these pieces of information, each individual (user) can execute his rights to demand their full traceability at any given time.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait a second?!? Sometimes even a delay of several microseconds is not acceptable.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p><b><i>For the app developers of personal-data fed solutions, delivering</i></b><b><i> on this is </i></b><b><i>challenging.</i></b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we provide you with worth-to-know insights on how Pryv.io notifies your app of any data changes from now; what are webhooks, why you’d better use them and how to integrate webhooks into your infrastructure with Pryv.io.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<h1><b>The wait is over : webhooks update data before you know it</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If transfer of information is happening in real-time, users expect to get updates on what is being done in the blink of an eye. </span><b>Having to wait until your app or your server goes to check on its own if something new happened with the data you are collecting is not acceptable anymore.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, this is exactly why webhooks have been created; and this is also the reason why we decided to implement them on Pryv.io. When you require real-time notifications of events, using a webhook is really your best option.</span></p>
<h3><b>What exactly are Webhooks?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By definition, webhooks are a way to set up a push notification to a predefined URL endpoint. It is triggered by some event that one wishes to be alerted of, mostly in order to act on it. These are automated messages sent from web services when something happens.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s how PayPal tells user’s accounting app when their clients pay them, how MailChimp notifies their users of common events such as subscribing, unsubscribing and profile changes, how Shopify keeps some parts of their users’ commerce and fulfilment system up-to-date&#8230;and how Pryv.io notifies your app of any data changes from now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put it simply, webhooks act much like push notifications. Each time when a data change occurs in the account of your app users, your web service gets notified. Let’s say for example a new event related to their physical activity. As soon as the new event has been created, your web service gets a message like “Hey, something new just happened on one of the accounts !”. A data change has occurred in your users’ data, and your web service got notified about it. You can now process the fresh and up-to-date data with your algorithms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Webhooks work the same way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point of contact between your server and the webhook is the URL that was provided at the creation of the webhook. You get notified of data changes in a web service using webhooks, that send an HTTP POST request to this URL </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with a payload similar to the notification message below :</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-6360 aligncenter" src="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/payload.png" alt="" width="427" height="180"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The server which listens to the provided URL receives the request and only needs to retrieve events and streams since last change to see what’s new. Nothing left to be done.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Why use webhooks?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having up-to-date data is crucial for your process or your algorithms to work properly. You need to have reliable information to be able to keep your algorithm at pace with data changes happening in a few seconds.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you don’t want to have to go manually knock on the door and check whether you have some fresh information on your user’s data account, do you ? What you want, and what you actually need, is the information to come to you automatically and tell you : “There is something new waiting for you, just come and have a look.”.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation leads to optimization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still not convinced ? Here is a concrete use case that can fit the service you are offering with your digital app, your clinical trial or any research you are performing with personal data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s say that your service integrates health or personal data using your Pryv.io platform, and you’d like to allow your app users to share their data with doctors or any other third parties, and to maintain the aggregated dataset up-to-date.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can easily do it now. Thanks to webhooks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How ? The user first consents to give access to the doctor or any other third party to his data. Each time he records new data with your app, the data is added and stored on the dedicated Pryv.io platform. The webhook notifies the web service whenever a data change occurs, which automatically maintains the dataset up-to-date.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The doctor can then retrieve the latest data of any user and consult the updated aggregated dataset whenever he needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user can revoke his consent at any time, which notifies the web service through webhooks and removes his data from the data record.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As simple as that !</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6362" src="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/webhooks-600x450.png" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/webhooks-600x450.png 600w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/webhooks-1024x768.png 1024w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/webhooks-768x576.png 768w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/webhooks-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/webhooks-2048x1537.png 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the key challenges of IoT data streams is to handle high volumes of data with fast connectivity without compromising on security.” says Stephan Bachofen, VP Software at Biovotion AG. “Pryv&#8217;s high throughput data ingestion will allow medical trackers to cope with future large volumes of telemetry data overcoming surges with guaranteed low-latency at affordable costs.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Healthcare industry remains among the fastest to adopt the Internet of Things. </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating IoT features into medical devices greatly improves the quality and effectiveness of service, bringing especially high value for the elderly people, patients with chronic conditions, and those requiring constant supervision. According to market estimates, spending on the Healthcare IoT solutions will reach 1 trillion Swiss francs by 2025 and will set the stage for highly personalised, accessible and on-time Healthcare services for everyone. Organisations need to ensure that future data conduits are powerful enough to handle and process the predicted throughput and increase in telemetry data, yet stay flexible enough to react to changing business needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv provides a future-proof, device-ready privacy management solution handling personal data thru its lifecycle. IoT data arrives in the form of a continuous telemetric stream, is rapidly ingested, processed for authorisation and then optimally compressed in Pryv’s personal data vault for sharing and analysis.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv&#8217;s purpose-built API is designed to ingest different types of high frequency data streams concurrently and efficiently. </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benchmarks performed on the beta release show notable improvements in throughput and storage density.<strong> On moderate virtualised hardware (4 cores, 14 GB RAM, 5000 IOPS), </strong></span><strong><a href="http://pryv.io/">Pryv.io</a> High Frequency stores 100’000 measures per second at approximately one byte per measure. The new release uses several advanced data compression algorithms to optimise disk usage. With an average IoT device capturing 20 sensor values every second, a single 4 cores  <a href="http://pryv.io/">Pryv.io</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> machine is able to store the data produced by 2000  concurrent devices.</strong> In a standard deployment, multiple machines would be receiving the telemetric streams in parallel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv helps organisations manage personal data from creation, to use, to sharing, archival and deletion. The High Frequency release is appropriate for health applications that require near real-time experience such as in physiology monitoring, critical home care services or point-of-care diagnostic. Our adaptive privacy out-of-box solution comes integrated with a secure storage vault, fine-grained consent management and comprehensive auditing capability that radical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ly accelerate time-to-benefit while addressing most stringent data protection requirements.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lausanne, Jan 22, 2018 — Pryv, the leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, today announced an R&amp;D collaboration with&nbsp;the eHealth unit of HES-SO Valais- Wallis in Sierre (University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland), to automate semantization of healthcare data for effective discovery and&nbsp;exchange across the patient’s continuum of care. The initiative aims to build (up) a common vocabulary and taxonomy that will pave the way for accurate&nbsp;and reliable data communication that can rationalize disparate Electronic Healthcare Records, augment the health level 7 (HL7) series of standards and ensure meaningful use of patient data.</p>
<blockquote><p>“One of the main technology barrier for providing patient-centered healthcare is the problem that patient data is often housed in a&nbsp;number of disparate systems across multiple locations” says Professor Michael Schumacher. “We joined forces with Pryv to include rich semantics in the data model and automate the import of&nbsp;datasets to close communication gaps.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Semantization provides interoperability at the highest level in the electronic exchange of patient information among caregivers&nbsp;and other authorized parties. This improves quality, safety, efficiency and efficacy of healthcare delivery.&nbsp;When correctly implemented,&nbsp;EHR interoperability ensures that providers understand the patient as an individual with a medical history and network. Its objective is to address the challenges of how healthcare systems inform various stakeholders involved in a patient’s care as well as&nbsp;how organizational facets of health information exchange will coordinate together for the benefit of patients.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The inclusion of rich semantics into&nbsp;<a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/">Pryv.io</a>&nbsp;goes beyond the traditional tagging and key word classification” says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO of Pryv. “The&nbsp;eHealth unit of HES-SO Valais-Wallis is helping us to incorporate algorithms from machine learning and rule inferencing that can progressively learn the type and variety of data,&nbsp;and propose/assign explicit semantics as it flows through our software.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Alongside of the R&amp;D collaboration, HES-SO Valais Wallis is making the&nbsp;<a href="http://pryv.io/">Pryv.io</a>&nbsp;personal data management platform available to its 2’500 students and staff&nbsp;members. The environment is designed to accelerate digital health innovation and enable eHealth research projects such as an m-health self-monitoring&nbsp;solution for patients undergoing physiotherapy treatments.</p>
