										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Lausanne/Switzerland, Munich/Germany 5th May, 2020 – The Swiss leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, Pryv SA, and Build38 GmbH, the global provider of mobile application protection solutions, announced a strategic collaboration to address the growing demand for security and privacy compliance for the Digital Health and InsurTech Industry. </em></p>
<p><strong>Security with app hardening and privacy-by-design backend are a top priority for </strong><strong>Digital Health Providers</strong></p>
<p>Fraud, privacy violations, cyberattacks, unauthorized data collection, outlaw processing, and hacking of connected medical devices and mobile applications are just a few of the threats arising from the digitalization of the healthcare industry. A hack, that can be disastrous for individuals, is just as harmful for businesses, who will face regulatory fines and damage to their reputation. Such threats can be minimized by implementing adequate privacy and security measures right from the very start. Protecting digital channels is invaluable on many levels, saves lives and prevents significant financial losses.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Smartphones and tablets are the primary access point for both our personal and work life, and a valuable target for attackers,” said Dr. Christian Schlaeger, Build38 CEO. “Business agility provided by mobile devices will continue to drive adoption in the mobile health sector, even more now with the announced DiGA initiative of the German government. Build38 and Pryv empower businesses to embrace the productivity benefits of mobile devices while addressing the security and privacy risks.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Developing the privacy and security layers of Digital Health applications is a highly demanding task, yet essential to gain users trust and achieve compliance.” said Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv “This partnership is a game changer for digital health innovation. It provides digital health innovators with a rigorously tested off-the-shelf solution, allowing them to easily and rapidly develop trustworthy and scalable products.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The offering by Pryv and Build38 foster compliance with the most stringent existing and forthcoming data protection and cybersecurity regulations. No dedicated security knowledge or privacy-expertise is required by development teams. Companies can focus on their core competency, while de-risking security and privacy compliance, winning time-to-market and fostering user-engagement through trust and transparency.</p>
<p><strong>About Build38:</strong></p>
<p>Build38 is a global provider of mobile application protection solutions. Its Trusted Application Kit (T.A.K) solution combines AI-platform and strongest app shielding technology which protects B2B and B2C mobile channels from fraud and reduces your compliance risk exposure.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Covid-19 pandemic affected ordinary life in an extraordinary way. Not only it impacted our health, our lifestyle, our economy, but also regulations enforcement. If the governments are still striking to find the right balance between fighting the pandemic and addressing privacy issues, they recognize the urgent need to adapt and are already starting to give updates on existing and forthcoming regulations. Here are the essentials you need to know to navigate the changes (at least for now, we’ll keep you posted!) within regards to managing personal and health data.</span></i></p>
<p>*This is a living document that will be updated on a regular basis.</p>
<h3><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6279" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/markus-spiske-wIUxLHndcLw-unsplash-600x354.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="354" /></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR: remaining within the rules.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) says that it is possible to adapt to the situation while remaining within the rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2020/statement-edpb-chair-processing-personal-data-context-covid-19-outbreak_en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data protection rules (such as GDPR) do not hinder measures taken in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic,” says EDPB chair Andrea Jelinek.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“However, I would like to underline that, even in these exceptional times, the data controller must ensure the protection of the personal data of the data subjects. Therefore, a number of considerations should be taken into account to guarantee the lawful processing of personal data.”</span></p>
<p><b>Consent and Data Collection</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Protection Authorities all agree: </span><a href="https://www.complianceweek.com/data-privacy/confusion-around-gdpr-during-coronavirus-prompts-edpb-response/28645.article"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">essential</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> information should be collected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, only in case that it’s necessary for public health reasons, public health authorities and employers can process personal data without having the consent of the concerned individuals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the concept might be simple in theory, it leaves organisations with a lot of questions and challenges to solve. To provide guidance on the subject, International Law Firm White &amp; Case has set out “</span><a href="https://www.whitecase.com/publications/alert/covid-19-and-data-protection-compliance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an overview of some of the key issues for organisations to consider during this crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from an EU data protection compliance perspective”.</span></p>
<p><b>Mobile location data</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">« </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the processing of electronic communication data, such as mobile location data, additional rules apply. The national laws implementing the ePrivacy Directive provide for the principle that the location data can only be used by the operator when they are made anonymous, or with the consent of the individuals</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">» </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">« </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it is not possible to only process anonymous data, Art. 15 of the ePrivacy Directive enables the member states to introduce legislative measures pursuing national security and public security *. This emergency legislation is possible under the condition that it constitutes a necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure within a democratic society. If such measures are introduced, a Member State is obliged to put in place adequate safeguards, such as granting individuals the right to judicial remedy. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">»</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Commission’s Recommendation on apps for contact tracing, published on 8 April and setting out the process towards a common EU toolbox for the use of technology and data to combat and exit from the COVID-19 crisis</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Jelinek, Chair of the EDPB, said: “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EDPB welcomes the Commission’s initiative to develop a pan-European and coordinated approach as this will help to ensure the same level of data protection for every European citizen, regardless of where he or she lives.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/letters_en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letter concerning the European Commission&#8217;s draft Guidance on apps supporting the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its letter, the EDPB specifically addresses the use of apps for the contact tracing and warning functionality, because this is where increased attention must be paid in order to minimise interferences with private life while still allowing data processing with the goal of preserving public health.</span></p>

<h3><b>MDR: Postponed. </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parliament adopted the European Commission proposal, allowing the application of the Medical Devices Regulation to be postponed by one year until 26 May 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">«</span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This postponement will take the pressure off national authorities, notified bodies, manufacturers and other actors so they can focus fully on urgent priorities related to the coronavirus crisis.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, said: “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortages or delays in getting key medical devices certified and on the market are not an option right now. The Commission is therefore taking a pragmatic approach and delaying the entry into application of new EU rules on medical devices, so we can have our medical industries pouring all their energy into what we need them to be doing: helping fight the pandemic. This shows once again that the European Union is leaving no stone unturned in our support to national public health systems in their hour of need.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authorities, in cooperation with health institutions, are doing everything possible to stem the rapid spread of the coronavirus. Insofar as private individuals (in particular employers) process personal data to combat the pandemic, the principles set out in </span><a href="https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19920153/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Article 4 of the Federal Act on Data Protection must be respected.</span></a></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">France: CNIL Recalls Data Protection Rules in the Context of the COVID-19 Outbreak</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The French Data Protection Authority (the “CNIL”) issued </span><a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/coronavirus-covid-19-les-rappels-de-la-cnil-sur-la-collecte-de-donnees-personnelles"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which outlines some of the principles relating to personal data processing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Guidance stresses that employers may not implement measures to fight against the coronavirus pandemic that would infringe on employees’ or visitors’ right to privacy, especially by collecting personal health data that would go beyond what is necessary to determine potential exposure to the virus. </span></p>
