The integration of Pryv.io is designed to meet the increasing demands from customers and regulatory body for more transparent and trustworthy management of sensitive personal information. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HealthyHealth encourages healthy behavior through algorithms and research data predicting people’s risk for medical conditions based on their lifestyle data. By using their services, people can take better care of their health, employers can nurture a healthier workforce while insurers can better engage their customers, personalise their services (offer lower premiums) and reduce liabilities.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Pryv gives us the required privacy rigour to build and maintain the trust critical for our continued success” says Etienne Bourdon, COO at HealthyHealth. &#8220;With an estimated 600’000 data points collected annually per person, we embedded a middleware technology that not only strengthens GDPR compliance but also scales our collection, use, and storage of lifestyle information.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connected health and P4 medicine (Predictive, Preventive, Personalised, Participatory) is a reality nowadays. Sensor technology, wearable devices and mobile apps are helping individuals monitor their health and alerting them to any early signs of illness. With lifestyle data, innovative players are developing value propositions that help insurers and businesses alike understand behavioural trends and score risk in a more granular way. Responsible P4 players are integrating privacy into their propositions to reinforce regulatory compliance, boost customer confidence and thereby increase engagement. Pryv.io streamlines compliance efforts and scales the process of collecting lifestyle data so that businesses can more efficiently perform risk calculations, offer personalised plans and optimise customer service.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“HealthyHealth is at the forefront of InsurTech innovation” says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv.  &#8220;Our partnership exemplifies a strong technology collaboration that unlocks the value of lifestyle data with behavioural analytics and an unwavering commitment to data privacy, protection and GDPR compliance”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pryv</a> helps organisations manage personal data from creation, to use, to sharing and enhanced GDPR rights such as transparency, portability and right-to-be-forgotten. The API is capable of ingesting high-throughput IoT data at scale and with optimal storage density. Packaged for rapid integration, the software solution comes with a secure storage vault, encryption protocols, fine-grained consent management and comprehensive auditing capability that radically cut IT development costs and accelerate time-to-benefit while addressing most stringent data protection requirements.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HealthyHealth.uk Ltd is a company specialised in assessing precise individual health risks, with the ability to predict percentage risks for more than 800 medical conditions, hospitalisation and mortality. Using this data, a second product focuses on preventing the detected health risks by transforming digital data collected into prevention opportunities with a daily personalised plan including nutrition recommendations, physical and mental exercises. HealthyHealth is working with several (re-)Insurers, Employers and Hospitals internationally with two products : a B2B risk API for medical risk evaluation, and a B2B2C mobile App for end-users preventing detected risks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information, please <a href="mailto:contact@healthyhealth.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">send them an email</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or <a href="https://www.healthyhealth.uk/?utm_source=Referral&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Pryv%20%20Partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visit HealthyHealth website</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lausanne, Switzerland, June. 15, 2018 &#8212; Pryv, the leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, today announced a milestone partnership with </span><b>Interpolation, one of the leading IoT Platform in Asia </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(www.nocxx.com) enabling an end-to-end management of Industrial IoT solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new partnership is set to benefit customers in Japan, Thailand and the Philippines with an IoT platform-as-a-service offering meeting the highest levels of data safety, privacy and user empowerment.

This partnership will broaden the availability of </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to customers in Asia Pacific and enhance the way they cope with sensitive data collection and utilization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a second phase, both companies intend to extend collaboration to Europe.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our partnership with Pryv aligns with our strategy to deliver best-of-breed IoT solutions that increase customer efficiency, productivity and quality of service&#8221; said Michiaki Satate, CEO at Interpolation. “Along our extensive experience in IoT and End-to-end solutions, we capitalize on Pryv’s expertise in data protection to design solutions that make the most of IoT connectivity while addressing markets’ strict regulation compliance, interoperability needs, and privacy concerns&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses on the leading edge of data collection and usage are realizing that they will not be able to continue their existing business model without protecting consumers&#8217; privacy. As data privacy increases in importance in Asia, Interpolation saw an opportunity to partner with one of the most rigorous privacy &amp; data protection solution provider to deploy a platform where connectivity, secure personal data storage, consent management and compliance software is combined to offer businesses a comprehensive managed privacy service that improve </span><a href="https://www.clarip.com/data-privacy/gdpr-transparency-requirements/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transparency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and user control regarding data privacy. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are pleased to welcome Interpolation to our partner network,&#8221; said Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv &#8220;The partnership capitalizes on the unique strengths of each entity; Pryv brings the power of its rigorous Privacy software capability to one of the most established and well respected IoT technology solutions providers in Asia Pacific; Intepolation complements this by bringing the benefits of its expert services and long-term relationships with customers in Asia to Pryv.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its initial phase, the partnership will address the privacy and IoT connectivity imperatives in Industrial and healthcare sectors where service providers are looking at keeping up with evolving regulations and protecting data privacy.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lausanne, 20 March 2018 – Pryv, the leading provider of privacy and personal data management solutions, announced today </span><a href="http://pryv.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> High Frequency, a new software release capable of ingesting high-throughput IoT data at scale and with optimal storage density. The new release addresses growing customer demand for mission-critical healthcare services with many devices connected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the key challenges of IoT data streams is to handle high volumes of data with fast connectivity without compromising on security.” says Stephan Bachofen, VP Software at Biovotion AG. “Pryv&#8217;s high throughput data ingestion will allow medical trackers to cope with future large volumes of telemetry data overcoming surges with guaranteed low-latency at affordable costs.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Healthcare industry remains among the fastest to adopt the Internet of Things. </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating IoT features into medical devices greatly improves the quality and effectiveness of service, bringing especially high value for the elderly people, patients with chronic conditions, and those requiring constant supervision. According to market estimates, spending on the Healthcare IoT solutions will reach 1 trillion Swiss francs by 2025 and will set the stage for highly personalised, accessible and on-time Healthcare services for everyone. Organisations need to ensure that future data conduits are powerful enough to handle and process the predicted throughput and increase in telemetry data, yet stay flexible enough to react to changing business needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv provides a future-proof, device-ready privacy management solution handling personal data thru its lifecycle. IoT data arrives in the form of a continuous telemetric stream, is rapidly ingested, processed for authorisation and then optimally compressed in Pryv’s personal data vault for sharing and analysis.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv&#8217;s purpose-built API is designed to ingest different types of high frequency data streams concurrently and efficiently. </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benchmarks performed on the beta release show notable improvements in throughput and storage density.<strong> On moderate virtualised hardware (4 cores, 14 GB RAM, 5000 IOPS), </strong></span><strong><a href="http://pryv.io/">Pryv.io</a> High Frequency stores 100’000 measures per second at approximately one byte per measure. The new release uses several advanced data compression algorithms to optimise disk usage. With an average IoT device capturing 20 sensor values every second, a single 4 cores  <a href="http://pryv.io/">Pryv.io</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> machine is able to store the data produced by 2000  concurrent devices.</strong> In a standard deployment, multiple machines would be receiving the telemetric streams in parallel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv helps organisations manage personal data from creation, to use, to sharing, archival and deletion. The High Frequency release is appropriate for health applications that require near real-time experience such as in physiology monitoring, critical home care services or point-of-care diagnostic. Our adaptive privacy out-of-box solution comes integrated with a secure storage vault, fine-grained consent management and comprehensive auditing capability that radical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ly accelerate time-to-benefit while addressing most stringent data protection requirements.</span></p>
