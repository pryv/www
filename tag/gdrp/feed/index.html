										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Lausanne/Switzerland, Munich/Germany 5th May, 2020 – The Swiss leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, Pryv SA, and Build38 GmbH, the global provider of mobile application protection solutions, announced a strategic collaboration to address the growing demand for security and privacy compliance for the Digital Health and InsurTech Industry. </em></p>
<p><strong>Security with app hardening and privacy-by-design backend are a top priority for </strong><strong>Digital Health Providers</strong></p>
<p>Fraud, privacy violations, cyberattacks, unauthorized data collection, outlaw processing, and hacking of connected medical devices and mobile applications are just a few of the threats arising from the digitalization of the healthcare industry. A hack, that can be disastrous for individuals, is just as harmful for businesses, who will face regulatory fines and damage to their reputation. Such threats can be minimized by implementing adequate privacy and security measures right from the very start. Protecting digital channels is invaluable on many levels, saves lives and prevents significant financial losses.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Smartphones and tablets are the primary access point for both our personal and work life, and a valuable target for attackers,” said Dr. Christian Schlaeger, Build38 CEO. “Business agility provided by mobile devices will continue to drive adoption in the mobile health sector, even more now with the announced DiGA initiative of the German government. Build38 and Pryv empower businesses to embrace the productivity benefits of mobile devices while addressing the security and privacy risks.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Developing the privacy and security layers of Digital Health applications is a highly demanding task, yet essential to gain users trust and achieve compliance.” said Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv “This partnership is a game changer for digital health innovation. It provides digital health innovators with a rigorously tested off-the-shelf solution, allowing them to easily and rapidly develop trustworthy and scalable products.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The offering by Pryv and Build38 foster compliance with the most stringent existing and forthcoming data protection and cybersecurity regulations. No dedicated security knowledge or privacy-expertise is required by development teams. Companies can focus on their core competency, while de-risking security and privacy compliance, winning time-to-market and fostering user-engagement through trust and transparency.</p>
