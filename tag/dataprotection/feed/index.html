										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Embedding privacy into software apps.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the adoption of the GDPR, we all expect developers to embed privacy into existing and forthcoming software applications. But ask a thousand people to define what privacy is and you’ll get a thousand different answers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some, privacy is nothing more than secrecy. For others, it is everything related to their lives. Yet somehow, we expect developers to know what</span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2019/12/08/10-facts-developers-should-know-when-developing-personal-data-collecting-apps/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the &#8220;right&#8221; answer is for everyone. Arguing that all they have to do is to &#8220;respect users’ privacy&#8221; when developing personal data collecting apps.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But how exactly? This is the part that we never talk about: how privacy should effectively be embedded into existing and forthcoming designs.</span></p>
<p><b>Hacking the privacy principles: turning legal requirements into 1s and 0s</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it is easy to say that developers should respect users’ privacy, hardcoding these principles into software systems is certainly not. Still, that is precisely what is expected from them, as the </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2019/11/20/gdpr-swiss-dpa-e-privacy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR provides numerous privacy principles for developers to implement.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What it does not provide though, is a clear guidance on how these principles should be implemented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, we observe that GDPR concepts like &#8220;data minimisation&#8221; are still a blur for lots of people. Indeed, according to the regulation, &#8220;Personal data shall be: adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’)&#8221;. But what is adequate and relevant to someone might be interpreted in many different ways. So how can developers know that they have it right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly, they don’t. In their study </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1805/1805.09485.pdf"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why developers cannot embed privacy into software systems &#8211; an empirical investigation</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, researchers Senarath and Arachchilage specifically recognize this fact as one of the main problems developers face when attempting to embed privacy into their designs: they simply don’t know how to verify that they’ve done it right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now if they would go deeper into the GDPR, developers would know that: &#8220;appropriate technical and organisational measures, such as pseudonymisation […] are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimisation&#8221; (art. 25 § 1 GDPR). The thing is: do you know many developers who actually have read the 88 pages of the GDPR? Certainly not. And even if they did, would they be able to keep track of all the data protection principles that it refers to and understand how to interpret them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t expect lawyers to be able to implement technical solutions. So why expecting developers to be able to understand and navigate the law?</span></p>
<p><b>Minding the gap between tech and privacy experts: a collaborative approach</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, this situation requires a collaboration between all these different subject-matter experts &#8211; lawyers and developers &#8211; so that they can build digital solutions that are both legally rightful and technically feasible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Pryv, we understand the burning need for such solutions, which is why we provide any developers with </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/27/data-lifecyle-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a ready-to-use software foundation on which they can build their own personal data collecting apps.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Call it GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA or any other existing of forthcoming regulation that regulates privacy and individuals’ rights, our software was built to help developers address the complexity of such privacy-by-design legal requirements and meet business constraints such as short-term deadlines and restricted resources.</span></p>
<p><b>Expectations can equal Reality</b></p>
<p>Today, we have set-up high expectations to have everything available on a click away. While it is easy to blame why privacy is not respected, it is yet difficult to challenge the reality of the situation&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So really? Are developers lawyers to be? Might be not, as solutions are there to help: </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Master the GDPR Compliance Checklist with Pryv.io</em></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not news: from two years already, if you’re a company operating with EU citizens personal data, you have to comply with the </span></i><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2019/11/20/gdpr-swiss-dpa-e-privacy/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (General Data Protection Regulation). Effective since 25 May 2018, the regulation sets out a number of legal obligations to be met in terms of privacy requirements and generous fines to be paid for those who don’t play by its rules. Yet in spite of its not-so newness, a lot of questions are still arising when it comes to GDPR compliance: how to achieve it? Where to start? How to leverage its requirements into a competitive advantage?</span></i></p>
<p><b> Master the GDPR Compliance Checklist with Pryv</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While lots of companies see the GDPR as a boring legal conundrum to solve, it is actually one of the best frameworks you can use to flourish and scale up your business. That is of course, assuming you do it smartly; we bet you would rather use your resources to enhance your application than have them stuck finding a way to answer on the user&#8217;s rights on their data: how to execute their consent, where to store their data&#8230; getting a copy of the data ready, process to delete it? At the end of this article, you’ll be the one ready to master your GDPR compliance and know how Pryv.io’s capabilities can help you thrive in the blooming personal data economy.</span></p>
<p><b>GDPR 101: a checklist to achieve compliance</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make it easier for companies to navigate the storm of the GDPR data protection and privacy requirements, the </span><a href="https://gdpr.eu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gdpr.eu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website provides easy-to-understand, compliance guidance through a variety of digital content aiming at explaining and/or highlighting the specifics of the regulation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Especially, they provide a free, online </span><a href="https://gdpr.eu/checklist"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR Compliance Checklist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that businesses can use as a framework to achieve their own compliance. </span><b>This is exactly where you want to start when asking: &#8220;Am I ready for the GDPR?&#8221;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divided in four parts, the checklist sets out a list of 19 things to be checked or done (preferably before going to market!) in order to reduce the risks of regulatory penalties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The checkups are regrouped by privacy-related “themes”:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawful </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">basis and transparency</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Security</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accountability </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and governance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy rights</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following, we will show for each of these checkups how you can leverage our technology to achieve GDPR compliance while increasing your business efficiency.</span></p>
<p><b>GDPR Compliance Checklist @ glance, with Pryv</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io is an extensible personal data life-cycle </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/27/data-lifecyle-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">management platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specifically engineered </span><b>to empower businesses </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">to rapidly create and scale breakthrough, GDPR compliant applications.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of organizations are skeptical about involving a third-party for their privacy</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; we get it.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let’s be clear: we don’t access or host any data. All we do is to provide our clients with a ready-to-use, scalable piece of code/software that can be used to rightfully collect, store, share and use personal data. Moreover, you can even choose where you want the data to be stored for each user separately, so it is both safe and compliant with all relevant data residency laws. Pryv.io will then be deployed on the servers and/or infrastructure of your choice. </span></i></p>

<td style="height: 456px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This part is about ensuring that the personal data you collect will be safe, secured and well protected. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As said before, we do not access or host any data. Using Pryv.io will thus not jeopardize your internal security; at best, it can also help you achieve it. Our software is privacy-by-design and provides encryption for data &#8220;at move&#8221; (during transmission). For data at rest: Pryv.io supports client-side mechanisms so you can add as many security layers as you need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io&#8217;s segmentation of data and aliasing feature (Release Q1 2021) also allows to selectively share data pseudonymized or anonymised if there is no data that allows identification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Pryv.io’s audit module provides information to security systems that can be used to detect a data breach, and further help you identify which data has been leaked.

Like banks that provide detailed reports of all transactions in time, classified in bank accounts, the Pryv.io data model provides all data in “time series” contextualised and classified in streams. It is designed to provide the same readability and transparency as your bank report, so anyone could make decisions and check its execution with a minimum of effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this context, Pryv.io can be used as a data controlling tool to be operated by your DPO.</span></td>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it is your job to ensure that your customers can enact their rights, on our side, we provide you with the functionalities to execute them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Built with a user-centric approach, Pryv is designed to ensure these functionalities while maximizing software performance and business efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Pryv.io allows you to provide your users with the option to backup their data on their computer or transfer it to another company (data portability, as requested by checkup #17).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(For example, we developed a ”</span><a href="https://bluebutton.pryv.me/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blue button</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” app, which will allow the data to be exported as JSON files and packed inside a password protected zip file in one click.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Our </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/reference/#update-event"><span style="font-weight: 400;">API methods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allow our customers to easily correct/update/delete data inside a user’s account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Pryv.io proposes a specific mode that enables isolation of per-user data in back-ups for deletion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our software is privacy-by-default (default opt-out). This is made to ensure that your users have an explicit choice as to accept or object to the processing of their data. All processes have a 1-to-1 relationship with the users of the App, allowing them to update or revoke their consent at all times. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is dynamic consent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a plus: you can further de-risk your compliance with the Pryv.io </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/25/audit-logs-in-pryv-io-when-every-single-piece-of-information-matters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data-audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> embedded feature &#8211; so that beyond allowing your users to benefit from their lawful rights, you can also prove that they were respected and executed rightly.</span></td>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on your core business knowledge and let Pryv.io optimize your organization’s resources for a responsible, efficient, and lawful collection, use, sharing and disposal of information.</span></p>
