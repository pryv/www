										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Thank you, cybernews.com for <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/evelina-georgieva-pryv-investing-in-data-privacy-is-not-only-about-fulfilling-a-requirement-to-achieve-compliance/">this great interview about Digital Trust, Consumer Privacy Awareness and where Pryv fits in.</a></b></p>
<p><b>Evelina Georgieva, Pryv: &#8220;investing in data privacy is not only about fulfilling a requirement to achieve compliance&#8221;</b></p>
<p><b><i>Today, everyone leaves a digital footprint on the Internet. Whether it’s when you visit a daily newspaper website or when you make online banking transactions. Unfortunately, not all companies put their primary focus on data privacy and that leaves enormous amounts of sensitive information at risk.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s essential that businesses would start seeing data privacy as an essential part of building trust and brand reputation rather than a tick-box to achieve compliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So </span><a href="https://cybernews.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybernews</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invited Evelina Georgieva, the Co-Founder and Business Development Officer at </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to discuss about modern personal data management solutions and how they can empower forward-looking companies.</span></p>
<p><b>How did the idea of Pryv originate? What has your journey been like?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv is a blend of ideas initiated more than 10 years ago. While overcoming leukemia, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/perki/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pierre-Mikael</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> got inspired to develop a solution that will empower patients to stay away from the hospital but still receive crucial monitoring and care remotely. At the same time, Frederic was eager to create a B2C digital place, Facebook-like but with privacy at focus to empower users to master their data sharing and protect their data ownership rights. Simon brought his digital ethics and privacy vision. I (Evelina) joined them when we pivoted from the B2C concept to create Pryv B2B as you know it today: a trusted software vendor of privacy and personal data management solutions. </span></p>
<p><b>Can you introduce us to your personal data management software? What are its key features?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We help organizations manage personal data from creation to use, sharing and disposal. Following the privacy engineering approach, we support our client’s IT teams to ensure that their data privacy compliance is done right: from the very early architecture design to the introduction of data-driven business models. We help them not only accelerate time to market but also cut IT development costs and speed up data utility and scalability across legal jurisdictions, such as the GDPR and industry-specific regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2015, we license our Pryv.io software which is used as a solid foundation to boost the development efforts of “integrated teams” of IT engineers, legal and business experts. The Pryv.io middleware acts as a “plumbing system” which ensures their digital platform has its best chances to engage customers and drive business values – covering the entire data lifecycle and the data privacy aspects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the bestseller features are the dynamic consent, extensible data model, decentralized storage for scalability, and data mapping for automatic integration with existing warehouses.</span></p>
<p><b>In your opinion, what data privacy issues should more people be concerned about?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is yet not clear enough that privacy and security are different. Unlike security, which nowadays is well understood by almost anyone, data privacy is still unclear. Privacy can be translated in different ways and have different meanings. While some will correlate it with limiting access to data, others, like us at Pryv, will look at data privacy as a tool to unlock data values. For us, privacy is not secrecy, but the ability of individuals to use their data, act on their rights and give informed consent for the rightful processing of this data. Thus, each stakeholder can win more from the unlimited power that personal and contextualized data can bring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My message to the users will be first to decide what privacy means to them and then take decisions and measure risks versus opportunities.</span></p>
<p><b>How do you think the recent global events affected your field of work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effect of the Covid pandemic, the growing power of information war, the upscaling Digital Democracy, and the rapidly changing Data Protection Regulations on a global scale, just to name a few, have been undoubtedly an eye-opening momentum for any forward-looking business. It became apparent that investing in data privacy is not only about fulfilling a requirement to achieve compliance but an imperative to build trust, protect brand reputation, and develop new revenue streams. </span></p>
<p><b>Some experts believe that keeping up to date with data privacy trends and requirements could even be the selling point for customers. Can you share some tips for businesses looking to update their privacy policy?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe that personal data aggregation, sharing, and processing should be as effective, secure, and trustworthy as online banking. This is a must-have to empower the user to understand the value of the data, how to manage and control it, and promote trust and engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this new paradigm, privacy is not a compliance tick-box but an opportunity to break data silos, differentiate products, and services and attract end-users with trust, transparency, and empowerment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We advise our customers to embed privacy-DNA in any process of their organizations, early in the development phase, ensure cross-functional team and privacy-engineering capabilities and thus guarantee they can deliver competitive user-attracting services and open up new horizons for achieving high ROI in a short period and overtime.</span></p>
<p><b>What dangers can customers be exposed to if a company they trust struggles to ensure compliance?</b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the obvious non-compliance and loss of brand reputation and trust, for many businesses, a data protection breach will mean a loss of business that could be as strong as pushing the business to bankruptcy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For users, understanding the trusted brand lacks privacy compliance might result in disappointment and disengagement, as well as pushing the individuals to act on their data rights (where is my data stored, prove me you have my consent and what so for, provide an audit on the data interactions, etc.) Incapacity to deliver will again result in impressively huge fines and serious business consequences.  </span></p>
<p><b>What are some of the worst mistakes companies tend to make when it comes to handling large amounts of customer data?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest mistakes in my opinion are the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undervaluing the importance and impact data privacy has on their business</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Misunderstanding the data privacy principles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-differentiating data privacy and security</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not being able to identify data categories correctly</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lacking efficient data governance strategy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing “bolt-on” patching solutions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missing the right team expertise</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Talking about individuals, what actions should average Internet users take to protect their personal data online?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before taking action, we advise users to be informed about the data privacy rights they have and then to act on them. </span></p>
<p><b>Share with us, what’s next for Pryv?  </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have recently introduced a powerful extension of our services by </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2022/04/01/in-cooperation-with-the-team-of-pryv-sa-open-web-technology-launches-its-data-privacy-excellence-practice-to-design-digital-solutions-ensuring-personal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">teaming up with OpenWT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As part of Pryv corporate development and pivotal time of growth, Pryv continues its full operations, focused on delivering licenses of its proprietary Pryv.io software, while data privacy consultancy services will be carried out by the OpenWT Data Privacy Excellence Practice.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><b>Digital Ethics DNA: still unknown.</b></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology made it possible to have the world at a fingerprint. As a result, every day, millions of users leave their marks in the digital world, making it possible for companies to frame them into predictive, insightful “little boxes”. The question of whether it is for good or not will depend on how they will use this information. Is our personal information treated and used with ethics? Beyond what the law says, personal data and privacy regulations such as the GDPR or CCPA, we all have an inner sense of what is right and what is wrong. Digital Ethics is something that we all wish to believe in, but few know about it.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Loud Silence of Digital Ethics  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in personal data mobile apps</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Futurists foresee a world where everything would be technology-enabled. Some even picture it as the perfect utopia. A world where criminals would be caught before they even act. Where patients would be cured before they get sick. And where everyone would find love. A world governed by justice, health and ideal match. A perfect world… or maybe not?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While striving for this world, the line between right and wrong became blurred. And all of a sudden, what was supposed to turn into a dream ended up reflecting an alternative </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273388/aclu-clearview-ai-lawsuit-facial-recognition-database-illinois-biometric-laws"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nightmare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a world that could be governed by “secret” mass </span><a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/new-german-law-would-force-isps-to-allow-secret-service-to-install-trojans-on-user-devices/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surveillance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, biased algorithms, and companies leveraging personal and health data to increase their profits; convincing themselves that they are, ultimately, doing it for the “greater good”. Does the end justify the means though?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much has been said about technology enhancement, the power of personal data in enabling personalized services, offering, care and treatment. Unevenly, opening-up the Digital Ethics Pandora box is a taboo. Without any further delay, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">now </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">may be the time.</span></p>
<h3><b>The road to hell is paved with good intentions.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It always starts with a good idea. “Make the world a better place”. “Save the world”. Yet most of the time, without a strong ethic to frame it, even ideas that started with a </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/03/dont-be-evil-review-rana-foroohar-tech-giants-too-big-to-fail"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“don’t be evil”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mantra are doomed to perdition. Almost everyone has lost faith in the very notion of privacy. </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/23/consent/"><b>Trust needs restoring.</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As being “data plumbers” at Pryv, we see it a lot happening with personal data collected via mobile applications. Inspired to make a big change, however, innovators often lose themselves in what is right and what is not. </span><b>It is not that the technology or the idea behind it is necessarily bad in itself.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But like everything, if you don’t know your limits, you will eventually end up </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/12/google-medical-data-project-nightingale-secret-transfer-us-health-information"><span style="font-weight: 400;">beyond them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite often being hidden behind numbers, personal data can reveal a lot about individuals. What people eat, where they go, </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/26/tinder-personal-data-dating-app-messages-hacked-sold"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who they love</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In a perfect world, these data would be used to suggest the perfect restaurant, optimize transportation, pay for what you use, not more and save us from a life of loneliness. In today’s world though, this same data can equally be used to escalate insurance pricing, enact citizens’ surveillance, and manipulate thoughts and behaviours on command. And without the enforcement of a strong ethics to surround personal data collection, this might just become our permanent future.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Yin &amp; Yang in Digital Ethics.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can envision two mirroring worlds where the border line is Digital Ethics. On one side, being mindful of what is right can open up a world where we will all be doing well, healthier people and happier insurers, empowered citizens and </span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/10/17/75285/ai-fairer-than-judge-criminal-risk-assessment-algorithm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fairer judges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Or, on the mirroring side where the code of digital ethics is not respected, we can end up in a world where we are all prisoners of our own digital twin. A world governed by fear, predictability and </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/02/age-of-surveillance-capitalism-shoshana-zuboff-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surveillance capitalism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So which one is it going to be? At Pryv, we envision a world where </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/06/08/pryv-sa-releases-an-open-source-solution-for-personal-data-privacy-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy is the norm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And while it is true that we cannot control the future, we are still empowered to make decisions today that can allow for better privacy tomorrow. In fact, it is that simple: it is a matter of choice to do it; nothing more, nothing less. Let’s build a world where treating users with respect will pay back: so be transparent, consent-centric, </span><a href="https://pryv.com/2020/01/23/consent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restore trust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and build meaningful relationships with your users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2012, at Pryv, we deliver businesses a solution to empower them building trustful long-lasting relationships with their users, manage personal and sensitive data rightfully, being confident in processing, but not « shy » for asking for more. More data brings more insights and we are all willing to share more when we trust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is always the hardest, but we got your hand:</span></p>
<h3><b>Privacy-first Digital Ethics Handbook.</b></h3>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respect the moral principles: apply the “do no harm” principle to personal data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish norms dedicated to ensure that the autonomy and dignity of users is respected: Provide your development team with the</span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2019/12/08/10-facts-developers-should-know-when-developing-personal-data-collecting-apps/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to implement it “rightly”.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow your users to shape the debate and make informed choices.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Personal Data Economy is Raising! We are offered a lot, but we have lost the essentials. Be that service provider that is there to last. Respect Digital Ethics, Develop privacy-first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yours,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephanie &amp; Evelina</span></p>
