										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Data Residency: where the</b><b> home for your data is.</b></p>
<p><b>Data Localization: a business choice or a legal obligation?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We live in a world where information can travel across borders within a heartbeat. Yet, if it can be rendered anytime anywhere, it has to be stored somewhere at some point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding out where that somewhere should be can be quite a puzzle to solve. Preferably, you want it to be safe, compliant, as well as economically interesting. But mostly, finding the right location for storing valuable information is a legal conundrum that you will have to solve carefully. Especially when managing the personal data of users from various nationalities, as each country poses different geographic limitations as regards to data residency.</span></p>
<p><b>The challenges of finding a Safe Home for Your Data</b></p>
<p>Organizations might think that this is an easy task. But at a time of global data exchange and the multiplication of data privacy laws, choosing the right place for storing personal data is becoming increasingly challenging.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on their business location, companies will have to address different legal requirements. Depending on the place of residence of their users, different expectations. And depending on the data they collect, even additional constraints and limitations. So how to keep up with all that?</span></p>
<p><b>#1 Address the legal requirements of your business location</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things companies should consider when thinking about data storage location is where they are located and which data-related laws apply to their location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, two things have to be checked: first, the scope of the law, which determines to whom, to what and where the law applies. Second, possible additional provisions such as the ones in the chapter 5 of the GDPR addressing the “</span><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-5/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transfers of personal data to third countries or international organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. Based on these indications, you will be able to get a first idea of what can be done or not within the borders of your country.</span></p>
<p><b>#2 know everything about your users’ location and their data</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another parameter to be taken into account when resolving the issue of data residency is the place of residence of the users and the type of data about them that are being collected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly, because some legislation defines their scope of application according to users’ location (like the GDPR). But also, because users are now more aware about data privacy and start to have higher expectations as to where their data should live. Besides, depending on the data collected, some additional constraints might be added by regional regulatory authorities, like the </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2019/10/13/pourquoi-la-certification-hds-ne-garantit-pas-votre-conformite-au-rgpd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HDS Certification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required for health data hosting in France.</span></p>
<p><b>#3 check the laws surrounding your third-parties&#8217; location</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now for economic reasons, some companies may be tempted to have their data stored in a country that is neither that of the company nor that of their users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, such decisions should be made wisely. </span><a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2020-07/cp200091en.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent Shrems II judgment of the EU Court of Justice (CJEU)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a good example of why transferring data to a third-party country might be problematic as regards to users’ data protection rights. In particular, companies should consider the issue of having personal data transferred within the borders of a country where the law provides government access to these data.</span></p>
<p><b>So where is it, the “right” place for your data?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is it in the EU? the US? Or maybe a little bit of both? Choosing a data storage location should not be a matter of choosing a good compromise for all the data, but choosing the right location for each data separately, so that each user can feel secure about his or her data place of residency. So maybe, the “right” decision might be giving the users a choice as to where their data should live?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now how can we help you with that? Companies can use Pryv.io&#8217;s decentralized design to individually store the personal data they collect according to their users location.</span></p>
<p><b>Take a peek at our solution: </b><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/"><b>Pryv.io</b></a><b>’s Regional data hosting distributed model.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io is a </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/27/data-lifecyle-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal data lifecycle management platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specifically engineered to empower businesses to rapidly create and scale breakthrough, privacy compliant products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Pryv.io, companies can easily store their data into a distributed environment to enable local (on- premise/per choice) Regulations Compliance, and even create installations that span the globe and co-locate the data with the users’ legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, with Pryv, all data is kept per-user, making it very easy for our customers to redirect each data to a distinct server according to their users&#8217; geographic locations. Based on a powerful distributed model, users are distributed among servers with no global bottleneck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each user account can be then stored on a different server, which can be located anywhere. The capabilities are set by the infrastructure in terms of bandwidth and storage. The architecture is designed according to the client’s needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to <a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/07/01/euris-and-pryv-simplify-personal-data-management-a-ready-to-use-solution-to-meet-gdpr-and-health-data-hosting-requirements/">Pryv recent partnership with Euris Cloud Santé®</a>, we also provide a complete data storage and privacy back-end solution.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><b>Dark Patterns in Action: Privacy-by-design or Deceived-by-design?</b></h4>
<h3><b>Enlightenment in Delusion</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trust in the Internet has been lost. Yet we use technology more than ever before. Every single day, millions of applications are being downloaded and fed by personal data. Whoever knows what it is being used for. We have been promised to be protected. We have heard &#8220;privacy-by-design&#8221; many times now, but have we understood it? Probably we did not. As we are still being deceived-by-design by many applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet things are supposed to have changed. &#8220;Businesses took actions&#8221;, we wish to believe&#8230; And some of them really did. The problem, however, is that we see the majority of companies only partially resolving the personal data management and privacy compliance challenges. Whereas according to the GDPR, privacy should be embedded in every aspect of personal data collecting apps.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting from the very beginning of establishing the relationship between the two parties, through the part that is visible for the users: the UI.</span></p>
<h4><b>The Beauty and the Beast in UI: Privacy-by-design or Deceived-by-design?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UI Design is a big part of today’s software applications. More than a pretty look, it is what allows companies to interact with their users and guide them through their app. In terms of compliance, it is also what allows them to ask for users’ consent and provide their users with the means to execute their rights to privacy. Which is why companies should be careful not to include marketing practices that go against privacy requirements when building their designs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, while we often speak about user-experience and user-engagement, we rarely discuss the “dark patterns”: the tricks used in UI designs to make users do things online that they would normally not do. Have you ever heard about them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark patterns are the tricks that make you:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Consent to things that you are not even aware of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Share more information about you that you really want to, an action that became popular as </span><a href="https://medium.com/@mohityadav0493/privacy-zuckering-deceiving-your-privacy-by-design-d41b6263b564"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Privacy Zuckering”.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Pay for things you didn’t even want to buy in the first place.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/Dark-patterns-born-to-mislead"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark Patterns Examples</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whichever it is, it is highly probable that you have been deceived-by-design many times already. The problem is: while UI design can be used to nudge people into making the best choices for themselves, it can also be used to deceive them into sharing more of their personal data than they would usually like to. But what is the “right” choice for the user?</span></p>
<p><b>Nudging users into making the « right » decisions</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If personal data collecting apps aren’t easy to implement in terms of compliance, they certainly aren’t easy to design in this regard as well. Practically: how to strike the right balance between best marketing practices and data privacy regulations?</span></p>
<p><b>When persuasion becomes manipulation.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the GDPR poses legal frontiers to nudge companies into making the “right” choice for their users, recent studies show that they still have a hard time going against their own business interest especially at a time when data brokerage shows to be a particularly profitable business. Yet, </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/07/23/data-monetization-how-to-profit-from-rightfully-managing-personal-data/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">there are other ways to monetize personal data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and even based on a privacy-approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some pathways and actions are more enticing than others. Of course, it can be fun to use gamification techniques to make an App more appealing and increase users’ engagement, but some lines shouldn’t be crossed. Especially when speaking of mobile health applications. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><a href="https://privacyinternational.org/news-analysis/3986/mental-health-site-sharing-your-personal-data-were-going-after-them"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mental health-websites that sell personal data, such as the results of depression tests, to 3rd parties &#8211; such as the case with Doctissimo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Is it game over? Take it to the next level: Dark Patterns for good</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Light the way. Dark patterns might be properly used. We have seen  typical ‘dark’ patterns, being used for the right reasons, for example in Open Banking. </span><a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/ethically-evil-how-to-use-dark-ux-patterns-for-good-e0af1e0443c9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethically Evil: how to use dark patterns for good </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the question remains: how to strike the right balance between best marketing practices and data privacy regulations?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is all about a shift in Mindset: Achieving privacy should not be seen as a problem, but rather as the goal. So </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/23/consent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make trust your first priority!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And next time you need to implement a new design for your app, start with “what” not “why”, and ask yourself: what is the goal of this application and how to ensure privacy-by-design, turning it into your winning ticket? You’ll be surprised what you can come up with!</span></p>
<p><b>Welcome to Privacy-as-a-State-of-Mind: We had a hand in. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For us at Pryv, achieving privacy is not about resolving compliance, it is the goal: privacy as a norm. As a back-end privacy provider, we can certainly help businesses collecting personal data to embed privacy into their systems, ensuring that the data they are collecting is consented rightly, managed and stored, compliantly. Yet, this is just one side of the coin. Companies have to meet us halfway to build a fully privacy-by-design, compliant solution.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Lausanne, Switzerland &#8211; Paris, France, July 2nd, 2020 – The Swiss leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, Pryv SA, and the leading connected health operator in France, Euris Health Cloud®, announced a strategic partnership for delivering a ready-to-be used solution for rightfully managing and securely storing personal health data.</em></p>
<p><strong>A ready-to-use data management solution to achieve GDPR compliance and meet health data hosting </strong><strong>requirements. </strong><br />
Companies willing to collect and use personal health data can now benefit from a complete, ready-to-use, and scalable solution, offered by Euris Health Cloud® (health data hosting) and Pryv (personal data and privacy compliance middleware). In Europe, the solution combines a certified HDS (*) hosting offer for security and a personal healthcare data management service for privacy, allowing e-health actors to rigorously manage personal health data and quickly create applications that respect the rights of the patient at an attractive cost.</p>

<p><em>”Contrary to what companies may believe, the HDS Certification of their hosting provider in no way implies their compliance with the GDPR. All it tells them is that their host offers sufficient data protection </em><em>guarantees.” says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv “The complementarity of HDS hosting and GDPR </em><em>compliance solutions is perfectly illustrated by our partnership with Euris.”</em></p>

<p><em> <img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-6592 alignleft" src="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pedro_LUCAS_CEO_CloudSant_groupeEuris-484x600.jpg" alt="" width="78" height="97" srcset="https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pedro_LUCAS_CEO_CloudSant_groupeEuris-484x600.jpg 484w, https://pryv.github.io/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pedro_LUCAS_CEO_CloudSant_groupeEuris.jpg 516w" sizes="(max-width: 78px) 100vw, 78px" /></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>The release of </b><b><i>Open Pryv.io</i></b> <b>delivers a free, full production, easy-to-install open-source solution for the collection and management of sensitive personal and health data.</b></p>
<p><i>Lausanne, Switzerland, June 9</i><i>th</i><i>, 2020</i> — Today, Pryv SA, the leading Swiss provider of personal data and privacy management software announced the open-source release of <a href="https://github.com/pryv/open-pryv.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/pryv/open-pryv.io&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591767266336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE5M5Nwx5D_-qMstxXIdiLE3h7Y7w"><i>Open Pryv.io</i></a>: a free and scalable personal data lifecycle management platform specifically engineered to empower developers to rapidly create and scale breakthrough, GDPR, and privacy compliant products, services, and experiences.</p>
<p>As developer productivity has become a competitive necessity, the ready-to-use <i>Open Pryv.io</i> is marking a turning point to de-complexify the development of personal data and digital health applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/26/data-pooling-get-the-most-out-of-the-data-you-collect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/26/data-pooling-get-the-most-out-of-the-data-you-collect/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591767266336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFeNPJDzmhUKSKsjHngsGZqfSJQZw">Data pooling</a>, data aggregation, consent management, and data interoperability are among the Open Pryv.io’s capabilities that are raising the bar for delivering a reliable solution for collecting and managing heterogeneous sets of real-world personal data with full respect to privacy.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“Releasing our core software in open-source today is a natural move for us. From day one, Pryv.io was built to be open-sourced” </i>says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO and co-founder of Pryv SA<i>.</i><i> ”</i><i>In fact, our source code has always been open for our clients. </i><i>By releasing Open Pryv.io, we provide any company with a tool allowing them to address the enhanced citizen’s right, which sends a strong message of transparency and inclusivity</i><i>”.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Fostering faster innovation and less duplication of effort are also among the main drivers of Open Pryv.io’s release. Nowadays developers value using open-source instead of redeveloping available code. Integrating Pryv.io open components will allow developers to free them up to work on what is unique in their products and add privacy-by-design to their value proposition.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>Open sourcing our code is doing the right thing – for the community, for our clients, and for Pryv. We should have done it much earlier.” </i>adds Simon Goumaz, Co-Founder and Board Member at Pryv SA.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Open Pryv.io release takes place at a time when the pandemic disruption has cast a harsh light on the notion of personal data collection and privacy respect. <a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/04/20/privacy-and-health-regulation-updates-during-covid-19-must-know-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/04/20/privacy-and-health-regulation-updates-during-covid-19-must-know-updates/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591767266336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8KIT8Lzn3rmvbgTUsTeMMlh0whQ">As governments have been lifting data protection restrictions in an attempt to ease access to personal data to protect public health, the release of Open Pryv.io shows that there is a way to encourage personal data collection being done right.</a> Open Pryv.io urges to build a world where privacy is the norm &#8211; not the exception as it is today.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“Privacy doesn’t have to be only secrecy. We envision a world where privacy is the ability to share your data with awareness and control. For years now, we prove that respecting one’s privacy and having access to their data are not contradictory. The more transparent you are, the strongest relationships you will build with your users” </i>says Evelina Georgieva, Co-Founder and CBDO at Pryv SA.<i> “</i><i>No more excuses: the Open Pryv.io offers developers a strong foundation to ensure that the personal data they collect are rightfully managed from day 1.</i><i>”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Alongside this new release, which offers essential features of the <a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pryv.github.io/www/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591767266336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE-r8KgdLMHIdcEULqtCN1s2XmMsQ">Pryv.io</a> software following an open-core model, Pryv continues executing its growth strategy by licensing the enterprise-class version to projects that require high scalability, compliance documentation and dedicated support.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Master the GDPR Compliance Checklist with Pryv.io</em></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not news: from two years already, if you’re a company operating with EU citizens personal data, you have to comply with the </span></i><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2019/11/20/gdpr-swiss-dpa-e-privacy/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (General Data Protection Regulation). Effective since 25 May 2018, the regulation sets out a number of legal obligations to be met in terms of privacy requirements and generous fines to be paid for those who don’t play by its rules. Yet in spite of its not-so newness, a lot of questions are still arising when it comes to GDPR compliance: how to achieve it? Where to start? How to leverage its requirements into a competitive advantage?</span></i></p>
<p><b> Master the GDPR Compliance Checklist with Pryv</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While lots of companies see the GDPR as a boring legal conundrum to solve, it is actually one of the best frameworks you can use to flourish and scale up your business. That is of course, assuming you do it smartly; we bet you would rather use your resources to enhance your application than have them stuck finding a way to answer on the user&#8217;s rights on their data: how to execute their consent, where to store their data&#8230; getting a copy of the data ready, process to delete it? At the end of this article, you’ll be the one ready to master your GDPR compliance and know how Pryv.io’s capabilities can help you thrive in the blooming personal data economy.</span></p>
<p><b>GDPR 101: a checklist to achieve compliance</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make it easier for companies to navigate the storm of the GDPR data protection and privacy requirements, the </span><a href="https://gdpr.eu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gdpr.eu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website provides easy-to-understand, compliance guidance through a variety of digital content aiming at explaining and/or highlighting the specifics of the regulation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Especially, they provide a free, online </span><a href="https://gdpr.eu/checklist"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR Compliance Checklist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that businesses can use as a framework to achieve their own compliance. </span><b>This is exactly where you want to start when asking: &#8220;Am I ready for the GDPR?&#8221;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divided in four parts, the checklist sets out a list of 19 things to be checked or done (preferably before going to market!) in order to reduce the risks of regulatory penalties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The checkups are regrouped by privacy-related “themes”:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawful </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">basis and transparency</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Security</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accountability </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and governance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy rights</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following, we will show for each of these checkups how you can leverage our technology to achieve GDPR compliance while increasing your business efficiency.</span></p>
<p><b>GDPR Compliance Checklist @ glance, with Pryv</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io is an extensible personal data life-cycle </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/27/data-lifecyle-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">management platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specifically engineered </span><b>to empower businesses </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">to rapidly create and scale breakthrough, GDPR compliant applications.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of organizations are skeptical about involving a third-party for their privacy</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; we get it.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let’s be clear: we don’t access or host any data. All we do is to provide our clients with a ready-to-use, scalable piece of code/software that can be used to rightfully collect, store, share and use personal data. Moreover, you can even choose where you want the data to be stored for each user separately, so it is both safe and compliant with all relevant data residency laws. Pryv.io will then be deployed on the servers and/or infrastructure of your choice. </span></i></p>

Using Pryv.io will thus not jeopardize your internal security; at best, it can also help you achieve it. Our software is privacy-by-design and provides encryption for data &#8220;at move&#8221; (during transmission). For data at rest: Pryv.io supports client-side mechanisms so you can add as many security layers as you need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io&#8217;s segmentation of data and aliasing feature (Release Q1 2021) also allows to selectively share data pseudonymized or anonymised if there is no data that allows identification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Pryv.io’s audit module provides information to security systems that can be used to detect a data breach, and further help you identify which data has been leaked.

It is designed to provide the same readability and transparency as your bank report, so anyone could make decisions and check its execution with a minimum of effort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it is your job to ensure that your customers can enact their rights, on our side, we provide you with the functionalities to execute them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Built with a user-centric approach, Pryv is designed to ensure these functionalities while maximizing software performance and business efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Pryv.io allows you to provide your users with the option to backup their data on their computer or transfer it to another company (data portability, as requested by checkup #17).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(For example, we developed a ”</span><a href="https://bluebutton.pryv.me/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blue button</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” app, which will allow the data to be exported as JSON files and packed inside a password protected zip file in one click.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Pryv.io proposes a specific mode that enables isolation of per-user data in back-ups for deletion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our software is privacy-by-default (default opt-out). This is made to ensure that your users have an explicit choice as to accept or object to the processing of their data. All processes have a 1-to-1 relationship with the users of the App, allowing them to update or revoke their consent at all times. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is dynamic consent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a plus: you can further de-risk your compliance with the Pryv.io </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/25/audit-logs-in-pryv-io-when-every-single-piece-of-information-matters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data-audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> embedded feature &#8211; so that beyond allowing your users to benefit from their lawful rights, you can also prove that they were respected and executed rightly.</span></td>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The innovative RWD eConsent solution is ideal for enhancing clinical trials with Real-World Data (RWD), achieving privacy compliance and improving patients’ engagement.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switzerland, Morges, 12 June 2019 – </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv, the leading Swiss provider of privacy and personal data management software, and BGO Software, a Bulgaria-based leading software services and product development company, have announced the launch of an innovative eCRF solution to manage Real-World Data (RWD) and informed electronic consent (eConsent).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designed to meet the requirements of GDPR and HIPAA regulations, the eCRF solution is based on <a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/#solutions">Pryv.io middleware</a> and BGO Software’s <a href="https://www.metaforms.org/">Metaforms software</a>. Among the key functionalities of the solution is its ability to dynamically capture and store patients’ informed eConsent. To ensure trust and compliance, a full audit trail documenting interaction with the data is embedded in the solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The web-based form-building software allows </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">researchers and clinicians </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to capture patients’ RWD and pave the way to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">useable insights</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> . </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This data includes information from complex forms, questionnaires, voice input, wearable devices, mobile health (mHealth) apps, electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePRO), environment and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RWD is considered to be a major source of valuable information from patients in real-world conditions. Capturing RWD improves personalized patient care and enables more efficient scientific and clinical research. Additionally, this data makes it possible to monitor a patient’s safety and evaluate risk, demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness, gain market access and address the public’s growing interest in an efficient and sustainable healthcare system.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i>“</i><i>Real-World Data is undoubtedly a valuable asset. However, creating and integrating dynamic forms and complying with regulations can be a very complex task and requires specific knowledge,” said Ivailo Ivanov, CTO of BGO Software. “Collaborating with Pryv adds an additional layer to the management of clinical data in our product Metaforms and ensures the patient’s data remains private. This is vital to ensuring they feel confident in sharing their data and giving us access to RWD.</i><i>”</i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the software architecture of an mHealth application is important to ensuring the successful implementation and usage of the solution, this is only one part. A user-friendly design is more than just aesthetics. It plays a crucial role in the patient’s engagement, the operational efficiency, and the overall management of clinical data.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i>“A regulatory-compliant eCRF solution is one of the most common requests we receive from customers,” said Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO of Pryv. “A user-friendly design is the key to collecting enriched RWD. By using BGO’s clinical data management experience and engineering know-how, we have been able to create an easy-to-use, modern and intuitive end-to-end solution that captures RWD and manages dynamic eConsent.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pryv/BGO eCRF RWD solution can be accessed anywhere and can be customized to fit the needs and processes of any business or organization. Its functionalities benefit multicenter clinical trials. An API for third-party integrations has been made available to optimize data collection and real-time sharing. The solution is easily adopted and can be quickly launched – a transition to a paperless process is possible within a few weeks and the solution can be deployed on site or over the cloud.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lausanne, 21 August 2018 &#8211; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv, the leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, today announced a </span><a href="https://www.rodanotech.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">milestone partnership with RodanoTech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the leading Swiss-based CRO specialised in clinical data management services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collaboration includes the development of an innovative clinical data management solution providing a comprehensive picture of each patient’s journey &#8211; one which combines patient reported outcome (PRO) data with clinical records collected by healthcare professionals. The platform is designed to meet the unique needs of the investigational research as well as the post approval market, including phase IV studies, registries and online medical communities.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><b><i>Patient relevant outcome measures</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are a proven necessity to assess the efficiency, effectiveness and personalization of clinical trials” said </span></i><b><i>Samir Mechati, CEO at RodanoTech</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “It supplements existing clinical data, increases treatment adherence and provides important insight about how patients are doing between medical visits”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The patient data set is expanding from the high-quality information collected in the clinical protocol to the more private data collated from wearables, mobile apps and in-home clinical devices. By streamlining the collection and integration of this dataset,<strong> t</strong></span><b>he joint Pryv/RodanoTech solution ensures a real-time connection with the patient health &#8211; capturing insightful data measured and influenced outside the four walls of the clinical setting.</b></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Real time, real world data that can be captured in patients’ daily lives is a powerful tool to optimise clinical research” said Pierre-Mikael Legris CEO at Pryv “</span></i><b><i>Our platform will not only capture patient data but will also give participants a view on their own trial dataset, sending a strong message of transparency and inclusivity which can turn them truly engaged</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”.</span></i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patient consent is a critical process that has historically been highly inefficient and prone to error. <strong>The joint Pryv/RodanoTech platform optimises that additional level of security between participants and clinical trial sites. Its greatest value comes from its dynamic, fine-grained consent and re-consent capability which gives patients the trust, transparency and control they require from clinical trials.</strong> The platform logs all authorizations, including the ‘contract’ between the patient and the investigator, for compliance oversight as mandated by GCP guidelines and privacy regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RodanoTech and Pryv offer tailored solutions to conduct projects of any size, from small Phase I studies to large scale trials involving sophisticated designs and long-term follow-up across clinical settings and geographies. Our Academic offer begins with a “get started&#8221; costing for proof of principles and goes to a premium packaged solution for large scale clinical trials. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lausanne, 20 March 2018 – Pryv, the leading provider of privacy and personal data management solutions, announced today </span><a href="http://pryv.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> High Frequency, a new software release capable of ingesting high-throughput IoT data at scale and with optimal storage density. The new release addresses growing customer demand for mission-critical healthcare services with many devices connected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the key challenges of IoT data streams is to handle high volumes of data with fast connectivity without compromising on security.” says Stephan Bachofen, VP Software at Biovotion AG. “Pryv&#8217;s high throughput data ingestion will allow medical trackers to cope with future large volumes of telemetry data overcoming surges with guaranteed low-latency at affordable costs.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Healthcare industry remains among the fastest to adopt the Internet of Things. </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating IoT features into medical devices greatly improves the quality and effectiveness of service, bringing especially high value for the elderly people, patients with chronic conditions, and those requiring constant supervision. According to market estimates, spending on the Healthcare IoT solutions will reach 1 trillion Swiss francs by 2025 and will set the stage for highly personalised, accessible and on-time Healthcare services for everyone. Organisations need to ensure that future data conduits are powerful enough to handle and process the predicted throughput and increase in telemetry data, yet stay flexible enough to react to changing business needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv provides a future-proof, device-ready privacy management solution handling personal data thru its lifecycle. IoT data arrives in the form of a continuous telemetric stream, is rapidly ingested, processed for authorisation and then optimally compressed in Pryv’s personal data vault for sharing and analysis.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv&#8217;s purpose-built API is designed to ingest different types of high frequency data streams concurrently and efficiently. </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benchmarks performed on the beta release show notable improvements in throughput and storage density.<strong> On moderate virtualised hardware (4 cores, 14 GB RAM, 5000 IOPS), </strong></span><strong><a href="http://pryv.io/">Pryv.io</a> High Frequency stores 100’000 measures per second at approximately one byte per measure. The new release uses several advanced data compression algorithms to optimise disk usage. With an average IoT device capturing 20 sensor values every second, a single 4 cores  <a href="http://pryv.io/">Pryv.io</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> machine is able to store the data produced by 2000  concurrent devices.</strong> In a standard deployment, multiple machines would be receiving the telemetric streams in parallel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv helps organisations manage personal data from creation, to use, to sharing, archival and deletion. The High Frequency release is appropriate for health applications that require near real-time experience such as in physiology monitoring, critical home care services or point-of-care diagnostic. Our adaptive privacy out-of-box solution comes integrated with a secure storage vault, fine-grained consent management and comprehensive auditing capability that radical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ly accelerate time-to-benefit while addressing most stringent data protection requirements.</span></p>
