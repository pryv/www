										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Building Privacy-Preserving Smart Cities: Myth or Reality?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From traffic congestion reduction to utility consumption improvement, care services optimization, new environmental and circular economy perspective, smart cities promise to enhance our lives in almost any aspects. Who hasn&#8217;t dreamt of such a utopia?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For every improvement in the city, though, there are significant risks for privacy that if neglected could lead to very damaging results for us all, if not the ultimate rise of surveillance capitalism, turning utopian intentions into dystopian catastrophe. In this context, solving the underlying privacy issue has become a must-have priority for anyone involved in smart city developments.</span></p>
<p><b>Myth: Thinking that digital innovation can only be achieved at the expense of privacy. </b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should we really make a choice between boosting smart-city initiatives vs privacy?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has been the question in numerous discussions around smart cities concepts and projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is indisputable that access to vast amounts of personal data is needed to make our cities smarter and enable digital enhancements. Yet in light of recent events that casted a harsh light on the notion of personal data collection and privacy respect, it would seem that the only way to ensure no harmful, unauthorized use of the data is to not share data at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what trade-off should we make?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">should we enable city improvements at the cost of privacy? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or should we protect privacy at the cost of general welfare and accountability? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The common mistake here consists of thinking that digital innovation can only be achieved at the expense of privacy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is this unwavering myth that privacy is the price to pay for better, personalized services, security or mobility in the city. Protecting data and privacy rights, however, should not be up for a trade-off in any future smart city.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what if there was a better option? </span><a style="color: #800000;" href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/06/08/pryv-sa-releases-an-open-source-solution-for-personal-data-privacy-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The release of Open Pryv.io shows that there is a way to encourage personal data collection being done right.</span></a></span></h3>
<h3></h3>
<p><b>Reality: </b><b><i>“Privacy doesn’t have to be only secrecy. We envision a world where privacy is the ability to share your data with awareness and control.” &#8211; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evelinageorgieva/">Evelina Georgieva</a> @ <a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/about-pryv/">Pryv SA</a></i></b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, locking all access to the data is not a sustainable solution if we are aiming for a brighter, technology-enhanced future. Benefiting from data-fueled solutions would not only help improve the city at many levels, but also provide us with new opportunities for self-development, bringing awareness to our patterns and unsustainable behaviors.</span></p>
<p><b>Finding &#8220;luxury in self-reproach&#8221;.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At some degree, smart cities could promote accountability and we might even find that there is some &#8220;luxury in self-reproach&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine a world where users would be able to step up and face the reality of their behaviours and impact on the planet, and where providers would offer the users real control over their data, including the ability to verify that it is used rightly, as well as real choice and transparency as to who and what services can access their data at a granular level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s up to us to make this world the reflection of our reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So where to start to make it happen?</span></p>
<p><b>The real deal: Consensual Privacy-Preserving Data Collection and Management</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relying on privacy-preserving technologies might just be the perfect option to start your project on solid rock foundations. There have already been a number of existing solutions that will greatly help you not only save time and resources, but develop smart cities applications rightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do have something for you as well: a ready-to-use, privacy-focused back-end solution to enable embedding such technologies to your project while addressing all </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/27/data-lifecyle-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal data lifecycle management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aspects, including consent management, interoperability and scalability. </span></p>
