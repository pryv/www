										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>September 23rd, Switzerland</p>
<p><em>The strong need for digital solutions to collect real-world data from patients motivated Magnes’ team to deliver on a novel solution for monitoring patients. Magnes’ solution will allow personalized medication and treatments based on real-world data in addition to enabling healthcare professionals to monitor patients remotely at ease. Embedding the privacy-by-design Pryv.io solution, Magnes combines user-friendly operation -literally, patients just wear the shoes- and accurate gait data collection anywhere with confidence. </em></p>
<p>Neuro-degenerative diseases are becoming a burden for the healthcare systems with the aging population worldwide. Today most available medications and treatments have limited success in stopping disease progression and enabling full recovery for neuro-degenerative diseases. Personalization of medication and its dosage is extremely important for therapies to work effectively.  Reliable, unbiased data collection from patients in their day-to-day environment is crucial in disease management.</p>
<p>Today clinicians rely on self-reports to gain insight into what a person is doing in daily life. The assumption that patients’ activity at the clinic is comparable to the at-home activity may not be realistic. The current high-end solutions in the market for analyzing gait are complex systems installed in clinics (camera-based systems, pressure sensitive walkways) that take a long time for patient preparation and for analyzing data. Even if they offer a good assessment of the patient, they are not practical for continuous monitoring of patients. Furthermore, being in a laboratory setting and under the observation of clinicians biases patients and the gait parameters can diverge from the typical ones. So far, no commercial system has been designed for monitoring the progress of patients, especially at home.</p>
<p><em>“The well-known “White Coat Syndrome” that makes your blood pressure higher in front of a doctor applies to a wide range of measurements. With Magnes’ solution, patients can not only enjoy the comfort of their home, but also provide accurate and genuine health data.” says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv SA</em></p>
<p>Most of the existing wearable devices collecting activity data or gait data from individuals work well on healthy individuals but they fail to detect clinically relevant gait parameters from patients of neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s patients, who have atypical gait.</p>
<p><em>“Pryv allowed us to build a platform within days, which is transparent and compatible with all data privacy regulations. Our platform gives patients full control over their data while complying with GDPR and medical data management regulations. It gives both our clinical partners and patients confidence to use our solution without any hesitation. With its various data integration possibilities, Pryv software will allow us to easily scale up our business in different fields and geographies.” Magnes CEO Dr. Olgac Ergeneman says. </em></p>
<p>Using sensors embedded in sneaker-like shoes and proprietary AI empowered algorithms allow Magnes to collect objective clinical-grade data during daily activities. Magnes has validated their solution with gold standard measurement systems and demonstrated the clinical usage at leading neurological clinics. Some of the algorithms run on the shoes to enable real-time processing for personalized therapy and can provide immediate haptic stimulation to the patient to improve patients’ mobility and quality of life. Magnes’ solution is first targeted at patients of neurological and movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, dementia, and incomplete spinal cord injury.</p>
<p>Unique in its offering, Magnes offers a continuous monitoring solution for patients to collect data during their daily life activities without requiring patient preparation and doctor’s visit. It has the potential to change patients’ life quality by improving their mobility with the AI-powered haptic feedback technology.</p>
<p><strong>About Magnes: </strong> Magnes AG is a technology spinoff from the Multi-Scale Robotics Lab of ETH Zurich. Magnes developed a continuous monitoring solution for patients of neurological disorders. Magnes solution enables collection of real-world data from patients.
