										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">September 2021<br />
<a href="https://www.accord-healthcare.com/">Accord Healthcare (Accord)</a> announced the launch of <a href="https://www.unifyhealth.app/">Unify Health</a> – a new app for cancer patients and their carers undergoing treatment. This new resource has been devised by experts from across the cancer community to support and advise people on their physical and mental wellbeing whilst undergoing cancer treatment. The app can also connect patients with not just local pharmacists in their area but also community pharmacists who have trained to become ‘Community Cancer Champions.’ Experts at the Royal Marsden Hospital, a world-leading cancer centre and teaching institution have helped to develop a practical, bite-size training curriculum for the community pharmacists who wish to become Community Cancer Champions. The training provides advice on how to talk to and assist cancer patients, particularly around managing symptoms and worries. Undergoing cancer treatment can be bewildering, with an array of advice and support available from many different sources. This has only been made worse during the COVID-19 pandemic, as cancer patients may have felt the need to avoid healthcare facilities, for fear of being put at greater risk of coming into contact with the virus.</p>
<p>Unify Health aims to be an app that is always accessible, no matter whether it is night or day that provides cancer patients a toolkit of tailored advice and information with the ability to locate community pharmacists with training on the management of cancer symptoms. Confidentiality is central to development of trust between patient and healthcare professionals. Ensuring privacy can help promote more effective communication and promote public confidence in the platform.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The Pryv solution allowed us to underpin our application with a secure and compliant platform for data storage bringing the application to market more rapidly than had that element been developed bespoke. Regulatory compliance in terms of personal data was at the heart of what we were trying to achieve here. All personal data collected within the app is managed via the Pryv.io patient data governance software and no patient data leaves the relevant territories (i.e. UK patient data stays in the UK, EU patient data stays in the EU). Pryv comes with must-have consent and auditing tools to keep the platform compliant with existing and forthcoming regulations.Their team were always on hand to support us through the onboarding and implementation stages of the project.” said Alex Williams, Head of Digital at Swordfish Advertising.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>About <a href="https://www.unifyhealth.app/">Unify Health</a>: Unify Health has been devised by experts from the healthcare industry working with hospitals,<br />
community pharmacists, clinicians, nurses, patient groups and charities to make support and advice more readily available to cancer patients.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>September 23rd, Switzerland</p>
<p><em>The strong need for digital solutions to collect real-world data from patients motivated Magnes’ team to deliver on a novel solution for monitoring patients. Magnes’ solution will allow personalized medication and treatments based on real-world data in addition to enabling healthcare professionals to monitor patients remotely at ease. Embedding the privacy-by-design Pryv.io solution, Magnes combines user-friendly operation -literally, patients just wear the shoes- and accurate gait data collection anywhere with confidence. </em></p>
<p>Neuro-degenerative diseases are becoming a burden for the healthcare systems with the aging population worldwide. Today most available medications and treatments have limited success in stopping disease progression and enabling full recovery for neuro-degenerative diseases. Personalization of medication and its dosage is extremely important for therapies to work effectively.  Reliable, unbiased data collection from patients in their day-to-day environment is crucial in disease management.</p>
<p>Today clinicians rely on self-reports to gain insight into what a person is doing in daily life. The assumption that patients’ activity at the clinic is comparable to the at-home activity may not be realistic. The current high-end solutions in the market for analyzing gait are complex systems installed in clinics (camera-based systems, pressure sensitive walkways) that take a long time for patient preparation and for analyzing data. Even if they offer a good assessment of the patient, they are not practical for continuous monitoring of patients. Furthermore, being in a laboratory setting and under the observation of clinicians biases patients and the gait parameters can diverge from the typical ones. So far, no commercial system has been designed for monitoring the progress of patients, especially at home.</p>
<p><em>“The well-known “White Coat Syndrome” that makes your blood pressure higher in front of a doctor applies to a wide range of measurements. With Magnes’ solution, patients can not only enjoy the comfort of their home, but also provide accurate and genuine health data.” says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv SA</em></p>
<p>Most of the existing wearable devices collecting activity data or gait data from individuals work well on healthy individuals but they fail to detect clinically relevant gait parameters from patients of neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s patients, who have atypical gait.</p>
<p><em>“Pryv allowed us to build a platform within days, which is transparent and compatible with all data privacy regulations. Our platform gives patients full control over their data while complying with GDPR and medical data management regulations. It gives both our clinical partners and patients confidence to use our solution without any hesitation. With its various data integration possibilities, Pryv software will allow us to easily scale up our business in different fields and geographies.” Magnes CEO Dr. Olgac Ergeneman says. </em></p>
<p>Using sensors embedded in sneaker-like shoes and proprietary AI empowered algorithms allow Magnes to collect objective clinical-grade data during daily activities. Magnes has validated their solution with gold standard measurement systems and demonstrated the clinical usage at leading neurological clinics. Some of the algorithms run on the shoes to enable real-time processing for personalized therapy and can provide immediate haptic stimulation to the patient to improve patients’ mobility and quality of life. Magnes’ solution is first targeted at patients of neurological and movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, dementia, and incomplete spinal cord injury.</p>
<p>Unique in its offering, Magnes offers a continuous monitoring solution for patients to collect data during their daily life activities without requiring patient preparation and doctor’s visit. It has the potential to change patients’ life quality by improving their mobility with the AI-powered haptic feedback technology.</p>
<p><strong>About Magnes: </strong> Magnes AG is a technology spinoff from the Multi-Scale Robotics Lab of ETH Zurich. Magnes developed a continuous monitoring solution for patients of neurological disorders. Magnes solution enables collection of real-world data from patients. Magnes developed AI-powered algorithms to provide personalized gait analysis and it can provide immediate haptic feedback to patients for improving their mobility.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv has joined the RealWorld4Clinic project which creates a device connected by artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance patient care. Pryv eHealth backend ensures privacy-by-design development and compliant real-world patient data collection, usage and sharing. </span></i></p>
<p><b>From reactive to proactive heart health: Inspired by consumer wearable devices, RealWorld4Clinic, set about creating a wearable that could collect data suitable for drug approval trials and guide interventions in heart failure management.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heart failure is responsible for five per cent of emergency hospital stays and two per cent of national health expenditure within Europe. Furthermore, COVID-19 pandemic has represented a clinical challenge in patients with heart failure. It’s widely accepted that real-world data is vital for diagnosing heart failure early. Yet, clinical research and heart failure management still buy in data, limiting the predictive power of clinical trials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By diagnosing heart failure aggravation from 30 days before an emergency event occurs, RealWorld4Clinic will halve the number of days patients spend in a hospital, while reducing hospital costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RealWorld4Clinic will achieve its ambitions through the market launch of SentinHealth‘s MyHeartSentinel – a coin-sized medical device anchored to the fundus of the stomach in immediate proximity to the heart and the lungs or, optionally, implanted subcutaneously in the chest area.  Equipped with multiple sensors MyHeartSentinel shall acquire a wide array of real-world cardio-respiratory health data. Via SentinHealth’s gateway and regulated through Pryv eHealth data privacy-preserving patient’s data management backend will be deployed on a cloud infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to co-creating the wearable MyHeartSentinel product, EIT Health will help resolve the ethical, legal and social issues involved with buying and using AI to maximise heart health data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In clinical research, AI-powered analytics shall reveal information on the real-world safety and tolerability of an investigational medicinal product or device. This is forecasted to add value to the decision making of pharma on the continuation of its clinical development. In outpatient cardiology, AI-powered analytics shall reveal real-world information on the pre-symptomatic progression of heart failure. This is forecasted to prevent heart failure decompensation while reducing the number of outpatient visits and days spent in the hospital.</span></p>

<p><b>About RealWorld4Clinic: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">RealWorld4Clinic is a new pan-European project aiming at bringing real-world data to pivotal clinical research and outpatient cardiology care. The EU-funded project is part of the innovation portfolio curated by the EIT Health knowledge and innovation community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MyHeartSentinel is just the beginning. Supported by EIT Health, the RealWorld4Clinic consortium is committed to transforming the standard of care from reactive to proactive heart health management. By diagnosing heart failure aggravation from 30 days before an emergency event occurs, RealWorld4Clinic will halve the number of days patients spend in a hospital, while reducing hospital costs.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>HES-So introduces EREBOTS: an agent-based framework forchatbot based on Pryv.io eHealth backend</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EREBOTS enable the configuration and deployment of personalized chatbots to support users in multi-topic and multi-campaign behavioral change programs with full respect to data privacy. Conversational agents coaching people fighting chronic diseases, addictions, and other health issues, leading to decreased life quality are among EREBOTS applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare and eHealth systems are facing the strain of a significant demand for user (patient) empowerment—implying the need for new logics, architectures, dynamics, and interfaces</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siri, Alexa and Cortana are among the best known intelligent systems that  have the ability to assist humans through multimodal interactions, including text, buttons, vocal, video, and gesture-based communication. Although such virtual assistants heavily rely on vocal interactions, sometimes more discrete and asynchronous chat-like communications are still preferred. Chatbots are an example of intelligent systems relying on interactions mostly menu/text-based. Anywhere/anytime availability, immediate response, confidentiality, social acceptance, and massive scalability are among the factors contributing to the increasing and an effective adoption of chatbots in a wide range of domains, particularly for motivational such as for social network campaigns and support, customer management, eHealth and assisted-living scenarios. In the healthcare domain, chatbots leveraging on tailored support and social aspects can be of great support to foster behavioural change, monitoring of chronic health conditions and primary care to name a few. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, most of the modern chatbots rely on state machines (implementing conversational rules) and one-fits-all approaches, </span><b>neglecting personalization, data-stream privacy management,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> multi-topic management/interconnection, and multimodal interactions. This leads to significant limitations in inadequate personalization, lack of real-time monitoring, reporting and customization for medical personnel, lack of mechanisms to integrate communities of chatbots, limited knowledge sharing capabilities, and the impossibility of seamlessly deploying multi-domain campaigns within the same framework.  These limitations are linked to the predominantly rigid architectures proposed in most existing approaches. Most chatbot solutions rely on monolithic and centralized data management strategies, making it hard to comply with privacy regulations such as GDPR, Swiss DPA. The sensitive nature of data collected through chatbot interactions makes it necessary to shift the control of personal data towards the users themselves, empowering them in the process. </span><b> EREBOTS uses an instance of Pryv to persist the user’s chat history and all personal data. Employing Pryv, users gain exclusive control of their data, thus being able to revoke the consent at any point, disabling EREBOT access to it, and, if necessary, fully removing any stored piece of information.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet EREBOTS:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-scenario agent-based chatbot framework: In EREBOTS, it is possible to combine several context-dependent behaviors that can be encapsulated in dedicated story lines, which can be modeled as isolated or interconnected scenarios. These behaviors are enacted by a network of user agents, doctor agents, and orchestrated through gateway agents.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User personalization: User agents build a model of the user profile, his/her preferences, history, goals, and aggregated information. With this model, the user agents are able to tailor behaviors and provide a personalized experience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare personnel control and monitoring: Medical doctors and healthcare providers have the possibility of defining possible goals, configure self-assessment interactions, or customize the types of activities proposed to patients/participants. Moreover, they can monitor users’ profiles with detailed analytics describing their behaviors and aggregated trends.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy and ethics compliance: In EREBOTS, all the sensitive/personal information are solely under the control of the user, who can make any decisions concerning storage and sharing of her information. Through the Pryv.io platform integrated into EREBOTS, users may configure fine-grained access control or even entirely remove their data if they decide so.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>COTIDIANA is a mobile solution that allows the remote monitoring of PROMs and sensor data from people with rheumatic diseases </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rheumatic conditions are a problem that affects a great percentage of the world’s population, with a particular incidence in the elderly, since these diseases tend to increase with age. The time gap between medical appointments makes it difficult to monitor patients’ symptoms and experiences. COTIDIANA supports data collection at home, in a more holistic and efficient approach, through self-report by the patient (signs, symptoms, quality of life), and also by passive sensing which enable the analysis of information such as manual dexterity, gait, physical activity level and sociability patterns (indicative of well-being and mental health).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COTIDIANA solution will include a smartphone app for patients and a web portal, that will be accessed by health professionals and that will display data since the previous visit to the clinician. Data collection will contribute to people&#8217;s medical care and drug trials. For the platform development, 130 people will be included in 3 clinical trials, which are planned for 2022 in Austria and in Portugal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io eHealth backend is used for the patient consent, the data collection, structure, sharing and storage, the integration with eCRF form and other clinical and hospital systems, as well as the foundation on which the COTIDIANA mobile and web-interfaces will be developed. The privacy-by-design and distributed data storage, alongside with the consent management and auditing capabilities of the Pryv.io eHealth backend will allow to achieve full compliance with GDPR, Swiss DPA, the specific ethical, clinical data and data protection regulations within the partnering and clinical institutions in Portugal, Austria and across Europe and will greatly facilitate complying with MDD and SaMD certification process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting in April 2021, the COTIDIANA is a 28-month project, financed by the AAL programme which involves 6 international partners: Fraunhofer Portugal AICOS, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Definition12 AG, Mag. Andreas Raffeiner GmbH, Medizinische Universität Wien, and Pryv SA. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pryv.io eHealth backend is available in open-source and under licensing agreement. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Human-centered and privacy-by-design digital transformation for the win.</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lausanne / </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aubière </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">16th Feb 2021 Pryv SA and Agaetis announced a strategic collaboration to ensure the rapid digital transformation in industries collecting personal data. </span></i></p>
<p><b>Incorporating natural human commitment, usability-centricity and subject matter expertise in privacy-by-design, Pryv and Agaetis deliver best in class digital transformation solutions respectful of privacy and seamless digital experiences, faster, at an optimized cost and right the first time.</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This partnership is for us, </span></i><a href="https://www.agaetis.fr/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agaetis,</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a great opportunity to co-work on great projects with </span></i><a href="http://pryv.com"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv,</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and its high level of expertise team. We feel that we are complementary partners to address companies&#8217; needs regarding data privacy and its management, from the solution edition to its deployment, its setup. Our competencies allow us to even design and create bespoke applications for a full package.”  says Nicolas Roux, CEO at Agaetis.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 and Covid-19 undoubtedly accelerated digitization in any aspect of our lives, making a strong push over the technology tipping point at unimaginable speed. Companies have rapidly started developing digital platforms that process customers’ personal data pumping great amounts of user data into their system: from digital health and remote monitoring of patients, education, infrastructure optimizations and consumer behaviour analysis in almost any industry one could think of. For each of these new digital offerings, there are a number of privacy pitfalls that if neglected will easily lead to very damaging results and loss of business. Meeting the highest privacy regulations became must-have priority for development teams.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solid, flexible, ready to use, here are some adjectives that perfectly describe why we trust the </span></i><a href="http://pryv.io"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solution. Perfect if you want to deploy a data framework managing data privacy, we figured out that it’s still manageable to even adapt it to an existing data management solution, as we experience it with one of our projects. The easy-to-use and heavily documented open-source tool, as well as the good communication with the Pryv team, confirm our choice! We are convinced that we will use this privacy solution in our projects, of course in the healthcare field but we are confident that it could be deployed on others.&#8221;</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says Nicolas Roux, CEO at Agaetis.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, to achieve winning digital transformation, technology is not enough on its own: understanding the relation between humans and technology is crucial to develop sustainable digital transformation. Often misunderstood, human-centric digitalization is not just about engaging UI and UX. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">To deliver a truly human-centric digital experience, it is essential to focus on key concepts about exactly understanding user needs, so that benefits exceed the cost of sharing personal data. This is the first and most critical step on building trusted, long term relationships.” says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv “We are very excited to collaborate with Agaetis: Passionate about innovative technology and cultivating collective intelligence, Agaetis integrates this cocktail into its productions. Data science and AI are in Agaetis DNA. Blended with our expertise in data privacy and Pryv.io technology stack for data acquisition, management and storage, we can offer a complete 360 digital transformation solution. “ </span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based in Paris, Lyon and Clermont-Ferrand, Agaetis is the Data and Innovation consulting subsidiary of the Novencia Group. It is a large family of 400 people with more than 60 consultants and experts in data sciences.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>UniRares (www.UniRares.ch) presents Patient support personal record: Empowering patients to take active role in their medical care</strong></p>
<p>In its first year of operation, the association UniRares has developed a paper version of the PSPR in order to help patients take an active role in their medical care, as they are often the best-placed to know their own disease, for better or worse.</p>
<p>This summary document aims at gathering and structuring all the different medical information that has been built over time, and should be presented to physicians during consultations. It can also serve as a reminder for the patient on the questions that he would want to ask during a medical consultation, and helps the isolated patient to gather on one single document the medical history, the identity card of the patient, the symptoms, the medical journey, the successful or unsuccessful drugs, the analysis results and the positive or rejected diagnoses. The “patient support personal record” can also be a tool for patients to set and prepare questions for the medical specialist in order to set short-term, mid-term and long-term goals together.</p>
<p>When the paper version of the PSPR was finally released in summer 2019, the question of the digital version arose.</p>
<p><strong>From paper to digital:  UniRares, LivingLab and the HES-SO Valais Wallis take the digital PSPR project forward. </strong></p>
<p>As you may have seen in the newspapers, the electronic patient record (EPR) is being led by hospitals from the Swiss Romandie under the name of “CARA”, in particular by HUG and CHUV. CARA is expected to launch and to become publicly available this year. It will greatly facilitate the relationship among health care professionals, and will provide a continuous access to everyone to its medical record. All this in a legal clear framework, and within a validated and common exchange protocol. This is a huge step for us, as patients.</p>
<p>In spring 2020, thanks to a working partnership between LivingLab and the HES-SO Valais Wallis, the digital PSPR project has been taken forward.</p>
<p>Yannick Mermod &#8211; a final-year student from the section “Information System”, supervised by Dr. Prof. Michael Ignaz Schumacher and Benjamin Nanchen &#8211; Living Lab Manager, has chosen to work on a Web Application for the PSPR as part of his Bachelor thesis, and to make it more extensive than the EPR. More extensive, as the amount of data for patients suffering from rare diseases is more important than for other patients.</p>
<p>A patient suffering from a rare disease needs solutions adapted and designed accordingly to his own needs and specificities. His life is filled with administrative paperwork required by his health condition, over-complicated and absurd insurance pathways and countless medical appointments.</p>
<p><strong>Usability and Privacy-centricity are the key components to  design a complete and up-to-date medical record, easy to be used on a daily use.</strong></p>
<p>UniRares is convinced that the rare disease patient must have a complete and up-to-date medical record to facilitate its daily use. His data must be at the same time secure and easy to share.</p>
<p>As part of his Bachelor work, Yannick has analyzed the needs of UniRares and has selected the platform PrYv (<a href="https://pryv.github.io/www">pryv.gihub.io/www</a>) to meet the requirements in terms of data storage. Mr. Pierre-Mikael Legris &#8211; PrYv co-founder, has demonstrated a high interest for this project, and has contributed to the project by sharing his knowledge of the platform and helping Yannick in designing the right data model.</p>
<p><strong>The very first Web Application of the “patient support personal record” &#8211; UniRares is ready to be launched.  </strong></p>
<p>It is thanks to these enriching encounters and the close collaboration between the different partners of the PSPR that Yannick Bachelor&#8217;s work has given rise to the Beta version in web format of the &#8220;personal patient assistance file&#8221; &#8211; UniRares. In order to make it available to its members, the next step will be to obtain support and funding to finance the improvement of the technology, as well as the hosting of the application and associated data, while guaranteeing privacy and confidentiality.</p>
<p>UniRares knows that patients suffering from rare diseases or without diagnoses are the weakest. Hence its wish to develop a mentoring program between UniRares members to set up and run this “patient support personal record”, while benefiting from each other’s experience.</p>
<p>This idea of mutual help is the DNA of the association.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Privacy-preserving-by-design using Pryv.io software, the OKCARDIO<sup>TM</sup> smartapp by HeartKinetics allows patients to easily monitor the cardiac function from home in less than 2 minutes, saving time travelling to the hospital and receiving more frequent analysis. </strong></p>
<p><em>Lausanne, Switzerland / Gosselies, Belgium – October, 2020 The Swiss leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, Pryv, was selected by The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) Inventor Award winner of 2017, the Belgium provider of daily home cardiac monitoring solution, HeartKinetics, to embed granular patient consent management and ensure data privacy compliance with existing and forthcoming regulations.</em></p>
<p>Being one of the companies incubated at <a href="http://www.esa.int/Applications/Telecommunications_Integrated_Applications/Business_Incubation/ESA_Business_Incubation_Centres7">ESA BIC Belgium</a><em>,  </em>based on over 10 years of research on astronaut cardiac function and its deconditioning in microgravity, HeartKinetics drives a real change for more than 121 million people living with cardiovascular disease (CVD) by turning frequent hospital visits for cardiac monitoring into a thing of the past. Instead, thanks to the advances made in the smartphone motion sensors and over 10 years of space research, patients can be diagnosed quickly or monitored remotely when they are discharged from the hospital. OKCARDIO in particular provides over six vitals parameters including breathing rate, heart rate and heart rate variability as well as exclusive cardiac strength and kinetic energy as signs of the mechanical and hemodynamic function.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“For the cardiologist, it is essential to assess both the heart’s rhythm function, and the mechanical function, which is usually done with echocardiography and lengthy examinations. Although there are many wearables for rhythm assessment, there is no such solution for the mechanical function assessment of the heart. Being able to provide a complete overview of the cardiac function with a simple smartphone is ground-breaking. Using Pryv.io technology, we can ingest different types of high frequency data streams concurrently and efficiently, without compromising on privacy and security.“ &#8211; says Pierre-François Migeotte, CEO at HeartKinetics.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>HeartKinetics presents two solutions, the OKCARDIO<sup>TM</sup> smartphone app that measures myocardial activity through the smartphone’s motion sensors, accelerometers and gyroscopes, which, when placed on the chest, can record myocardial contraction efforts and rhythm. The second one, “the KINO<sup>TM</sup>” portable device, is a medical device made of two units, one of which is placed on the chest and the other on the lower back. After an initial calibration by a cardiologist, patients can take measurements at home in less than two minutes and transmit them for diagnosis via a smartphone or tablet. This provides an accurate assessment of both mechanical and electrical myocardial functions, together with hemodynamic parameters.  Based on the patient’s consent, captured and managed by Pryv.io technology,  KINO can frequently share information about a patient’s cardiac health status with their healthcare teams  which is essential for the management of heart failure.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>People living with cardiovascular disease have been among those affected the most during the pandemic. It became clear that there is an urgent need to bring remote monitoring solutions for performing cardiac function tests at home. HeartKinetics addresses such a need with an easy-to-use, breakthrough, scientific-proven technology, already tested and validated, that makes remote heart monitoring possible in a quick and efficient way, from the comfort of the patient&#8217;s home. In addition, patients can easily communicate with their physicians and share their data confidently among medical teams with full respect of the data privacy.</em>&#8221; says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv SA.</p></blockquote>
<p>Preserving privacy in remote health is not a miracle, but the way to be: Pryv.io’s privacy by design technology provides a robust, secure and consent-based backend solution that is designed to prove this. Moreover, the Pryv and HeartKinetics collaboration confirms that it is possible to empower doctors and patients with a deep respect for the confidentiality of the data.</p>
<p>The combination of HeartKinetics health innovation and Pryv.io privacy technology brings light to a critical issue in a time of emerging need. It provides a sustainable, pandemic-proof healthcare solution that is aligned with stringent data privacy requirements.</p>
<p>The KINO device has already been used in clinical trials in the Netherlands Germany and Belgium. OKCARDIO is in its final stage of clinical validations and will be available in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Pryv and CYSEC launch an integrated privacy-preserving solution for collection and confidential computing of personal data at scale.</strong></p>
<p>Lausanne, Switzerland – October 6<sup>th</sup>, 2020</p>
<p><em>Two leading Swiss providers of privacy and security solutions, Pryv and CYSEC, announce a strategic collaboration focused on integrating their products: the personal data &amp; consent management middleware Pryv.io and the confidential computing solution ARCA from CYSEC. The two Swiss trust-tech companies are jointly pursuing strategic opportunities as part of their growth strategies.</em></p>
<p>Businesses operating in highly regulated markets such as healthcare, insurtech, mobility and fintech collect, use, and store sensitive personal data at scale. They must therefore adopt the highest privacy and security standards to ensure that data remains protected throughout the full lifecycle and across all three states of data: data at rest, in transit and in use. The need for secure data management has spawned a new era of data protection and privacy regulation and practices including: GDPR; Swiss DPA; CCPA, PIPEDA. And more stringent regulation will follow.</p>
<p>Organizations face regulatory constraints at many stages of software design and must make decisions on how best to manage access control rights, provide data auditing capabilities and store / host data.  As more organisations and entire industries embrace the collection of personal data and its processing, they too will become subject to highly stringent regulations.</p>
<p>While the collection and use of personal data has become increasingly mainstream, only few organisations have invested in reliable data management and storage solutions that provide the necessary security and privacy. Most organisations remain without protection. The risk is not only a potential fine of 20M EUR or more, but also losing the trust of users. Once lost, user trust and an organisations reputation are very hard to regain. To avoid this, it is imperative to work with the right privacy and security tools.</p>
<p>The Pryv.io Personal Data &amp; Privacy Management Software allows businesses to build digital solutions that can collect, store, share and rightfully use personal data. It comes with must-have consent and auditing tools to keep the clients compliant with existing and forthcoming regulations.</p>
<p>The ARCA solution leverages certified hardware to secure data in use, enabling sensitive data to be processed inside a trusted execution environment. In this way, data can be processed without exposing it to the rest of the system, reducing exposure of sensitive data and providing greater control and transparency for users. Its main advantage is the ease of integration as it is compatible with modern virtualization tools that software developers use, including Docker, Kubernetes, VMWare. The solution can be deployed in centralized, decentralized and distributed architectures.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Pierre-Mikael Legris</strong>, CEO at Pryv SA said: “By combining ARCA and Pryv.io, companies will blend best of breed security and privacy- by-design technologies for their backend and enhance trust for their customers.”</p>
<p><strong>Florian Wiedmann</strong>, Secure Analytics Manager at CYSEC commented: “Organisations looking to comply with increasingly stringent data regulation require a one-stop solution for all their data security and management needs. Teaming up with Pryv will allow us to achieve this goal: A solution that offers both security and critical data management tools to allow organisations to achieve compliance easily.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Trust is critical for companies that manage personal data. Combining ARCA&#8217;s security and Pryv.io&#8217;s privacy by design technology provide a robust, secure and consent-based backend to achieve trust. The integration of Pryv.io and ARCA provides businesses with an easy to deploy solution to collect, structure, share, use and store personal and sensitive data without compromising on security and compliance. ARCA and Pryv.io are further integrated with <a href="https://build38.com/the-trusted-application-kit/">TAK by Build38.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Lausanne, Switzerland &#8211; Paris, France, July 2nd, 2020 – The Swiss leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, Pryv SA, and the leading connected health operator in France, Euris Health Cloud®, announced a strategic partnership for delivering a ready-to-be used solution for rightfully managing and securely storing personal health data.</em></p>
<p><strong>A ready-to-use data management solution to achieve GDPR compliance and meet health data hosting </strong><strong>requirements. </strong><br />

<p><em>”Contrary to what companies may believe, the HDS Certification of their hosting provider in no way implies their compliance with the GDPR. All it tells them is that their host offers sufficient data protection </em><em>guarantees.” says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv “The complementarity of HDS hosting and GDPR </em><em>compliance solutions is perfectly illustrated by our partnership with Euris.”</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>The release of </b><b><i>Open Pryv.io</i></b> <b>delivers a free, full production, easy-to-install open-source solution for the collection and management of sensitive personal and health data.</b></p>
<p><i>Lausanne, Switzerland, June 9</i><i>th</i><i>, 2020</i> — Today, Pryv SA, the leading Swiss provider of personal data and privacy management software announced the open-source release of <a href="https://github.com/pryv/open-pryv.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/pryv/open-pryv.io&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591767266336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE5M5Nwx5D_-qMstxXIdiLE3h7Y7w"><i>Open Pryv.io</i></a>: a free and scalable personal data lifecycle management platform specifically engineered to empower developers to rapidly create and scale breakthrough, GDPR, and privacy compliant products, services, and experiences.</p>
<p>As developer productivity has become a competitive necessity, the ready-to-use <i>Open Pryv.io</i> is marking a turning point to de-complexify the development of personal data and digital health applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/26/data-pooling-get-the-most-out-of-the-data-you-collect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/01/26/data-pooling-get-the-most-out-of-the-data-you-collect/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591767266336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFeNPJDzmhUKSKsjHngsGZqfSJQZw">Data pooling</a>, data aggregation, consent management, and data interoperability are among the Open Pryv.io’s capabilities that are raising the bar for delivering a reliable solution for collecting and managing heterogeneous sets of real-world personal data with full respect to privacy.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“Releasing our core software in open-source today is a natural move for us. From day one, Pryv.io was built to be open-sourced” </i>says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO and co-founder of Pryv SA<i>.</i><i> ”</i><i>In fact, our source code has always been open for our clients. </i><i>By releasing Open Pryv.io, we provide any company with a tool allowing them to address the enhanced citizen’s right, which sends a strong message of transparency and inclusivity</i><i>”.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Fostering faster innovation and less duplication of effort are also among the main drivers of Open Pryv.io’s release. Nowadays developers value using open-source instead of redeveloping available code. Integrating Pryv.io open components will allow developers to free them up to work on what is unique in their products and add privacy-by-design to their value proposition.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>Open sourcing our code is doing the right thing – for the community, for our clients, and for Pryv. We should have done it much earlier.” </i>adds Simon Goumaz, Co-Founder and Board Member at Pryv SA.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Open Pryv.io release takes place at a time when the pandemic disruption has cast a harsh light on the notion of personal data collection and privacy respect. <a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/04/20/privacy-and-health-regulation-updates-during-covid-19-must-know-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pryv.github.io/www/2020/04/20/privacy-and-health-regulation-updates-during-covid-19-must-know-updates/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591767266336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8KIT8Lzn3rmvbgTUsTeMMlh0whQ">As governments have been lifting data protection restrictions in an attempt to ease access to personal data to protect public health, the release of Open Pryv.io shows that there is a way to encourage personal data collection being done right.</a> Open Pryv.io urges to build a world where privacy is the norm &#8211; not the exception as it is today.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“Privacy doesn’t have to be only secrecy. We envision a world where privacy is the ability to share your data with awareness and control. For years now, we prove that respecting one’s privacy and having access to their data are not contradictory. The more transparent you are, the strongest relationships you will build with your users” </i>says Evelina Georgieva, Co-Founder and CBDO at Pryv SA.<i> “</i><i>No more excuses: the Open Pryv.io offers developers a strong foundation to ensure that the personal data they collect are rightfully managed from day 1.</i><i>”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Alongside this new release, which offers essential features of the <a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pryv.github.io/www/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591767266336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE-r8KgdLMHIdcEULqtCN1s2XmMsQ">Pryv.io</a> software following an open-core model, Pryv continues executing its growth strategy by licensing the enterprise-class version to projects that require high scalability, compliance documentation and dedicated support.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Lausanne/Bern, Switzerland, October 29<sup>th</sup>,  2019 – </strong>The Swiss leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, Pryv, was selected by the family practice Huttwil GmbH to enhance the patient-doctor communication of its intelligent booking tool, umana, by providing advanced privacy-preserving capabilities. Scheduled to launch in Q1 of 2020, the eHealth solution allows patients to send relevant data directly to their doctor while scheduling an appointment. Patients can book appointments and complete online evidence-based health check-ups in the app. For doctors, umana can help manage their agenda, set online appointments and perform check-ups. Through all this, Pryv ensures that the patient-doctor relationship is built on a foundation of trust by integrating comprehensive consent management and secure data management capabilities.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Dr. Damian Meli, Project lead at umana,</em></strong><em> said: “This partnership represents a further step in umana’s journey to building the most user-centric patient-doctor communication tool to be integrated with the Swiss Electronic Health Record system. Comprehensive data protection and compliance with data management regulations are essential to our development. We chose Pryv because they share our belief that the confidentiality and privacy of our users is a top priority. The integration of the pryv.io software is designed to meet the increasing demands from patients and regulating authorities for more transparent and trustworthy methods for the management of personal data.”</em></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong><em>Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO and co-founder of Pryv SA</em></strong><em>, said: “We are proud to have been chosen by umana. It shows that they are committed to the increasing value of digitized content in healthcare. By working with some of the world’s eHealth pioneers, like umana, Pyrv can accumulate reliable industry experience which we can deploy in our development and agile operating model. Not only has umana demonstrated that they value each patient, but they are also interested in building a relationship based on trust with them, which will surely foster more efficient digital communication between patients and healthcare providers.”   </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Pryv’s privacy-by-design approach promotes privacy and data protection compliance to guide patients’ data security decisions throughout their experience with a tool such as umana. As healthcare organizations increasingly integrate personal data into their services and processes, they continuously encounter the challenges of compliance and the chances of a breach of private data. Unfortunately, the defense mechanisms are often added on to existing structures as an after-thought, or in some cases, ignored altogether despite the fact that they should be embedded into the foundation of the system.</p>
<p>As an eHealth platform, umana aims to connect service providers, such as doctors or pharmacists, with their patients. The solution will allow for appointment booking, direct messaging, medication plans and, in the future, Swiss EPD – all regulated via one access point. For patients, umana will allow them to book appointments and share vital parameters and personal information with doctors through web and smartphone applications. Thanks to Pryv, this transparent exchange of private information will be compliant with GDPR and Swiss DPA regulations.</p>
<p><strong>About umana</strong></p>
<p>umana is a new Swiss health platform that offers products and services for patients and doctors. As an international team of family doctors and engineers, we have used our expertise and creativity to reduce and optimize the wait time before a patient meets with their healthcare provider. The booking tool can be easily integrated into any practice and makes consultations more streamlined and more pleasant for patients. At umana, we harness the power of digitalization to create comprehensive, relevant and personalized health services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The innovative RWD eConsent solution is ideal for enhancing clinical trials with Real-World Data (RWD), achieving privacy compliance and improving patients’ engagement.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switzerland, Morges, 12 June 2019 – </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv, the leading Swiss provider of privacy and personal data management software, and BGO Software, a Bulgaria-based leading software services and product development company, have announced the launch of an innovative eCRF solution to manage Real-World Data (RWD) and informed electronic consent (eConsent).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designed to meet the requirements of GDPR and HIPAA regulations, the eCRF solution is based on <a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/#solutions">Pryv.io middleware</a> and BGO Software’s <a href="https://www.metaforms.org/">Metaforms software</a>. Among the key functionalities of the solution is its ability to dynamically capture and store patients’ informed eConsent. To ensure trust and compliance, a full audit trail documenting interaction with the data is embedded in the solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The web-based form-building software allows </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">researchers and clinicians </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to capture patients’ RWD and pave the way to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">useable insights</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> . </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This data includes information from complex forms, questionnaires, voice input, wearable devices, mobile health (mHealth) apps, electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePRO), environment and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RWD is considered to be a major source of valuable information from patients in real-world conditions. Capturing RWD improves personalized patient care and enables more efficient scientific and clinical research. Additionally, this data makes it possible to monitor a patient’s safety and evaluate risk, demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness, gain market access and address the public’s growing interest in an efficient and sustainable healthcare system.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i>“</i><i>Real-World Data is undoubtedly a valuable asset. However, creating and integrating dynamic forms and complying with regulations can be a very complex task and requires specific knowledge,” said Ivailo Ivanov, CTO of BGO Software. “Collaborating with Pryv adds an additional layer to the management of clinical data in our product Metaforms and ensures the patient’s data remains private. This is vital to ensuring they feel confident in sharing their data and giving us access to RWD.</i><i>”</i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the software architecture of an mHealth application is important to ensuring the successful implementation and usage of the solution, this is only one part. A user-friendly design is more than just aesthetics. It plays a crucial role in the patient’s engagement, the operational efficiency, and the overall management of clinical data.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i>“A regulatory-compliant eCRF solution is one of the most common requests we receive from customers,” said Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO of Pryv. “A user-friendly design is the key to collecting enriched RWD. By using BGO’s clinical data management experience and engineering know-how, we have been able to create an easy-to-use, modern and intuitive end-to-end solution that captures RWD and manages dynamic eConsent.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pryv/BGO eCRF RWD solution can be accessed anywhere and can be customized to fit the needs and processes of any business or organization. Its functionalities benefit multicenter clinical trials. An API for third-party integrations has been made available to optimize data collection and real-time sharing. The solution is easily adopted and can be quickly launched – a transition to a paperless process is possible within a few weeks and the solution can be deployed on site or over the cloud.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grâce aux données de santé, il est possible de déduire l’état de santé, aussi bien physique que mentale, d’un individu et ainsi lui apporter des soins plus personnalisés en accord avec le style de vie de la personne. Alors que la PDétait auparavant collectée par le médecin ou l’hôpital, la collecte se fait désormais via des appareils connectés ou des applications. « Exploitées et contextualisées, les données d’un bracelet connecté peuvent informer sur la condition physique d’une personne ou encore sur ses habitudes de vie. Avec les données GPS d’un individu, s’il sort régulièrement de son bureau dans la journée, on peut ainsi en déduire qu’il est fumeur, ce qui est important pendant une étude clinique » explique Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO de PRYV.</p>
<p>Au-delà d’être une simple contrainte légale, le RGPD, le Règlement général sur la protection des données, apporte un contexte à la donnée privée. « L’entreprise qui collecte des données personnelles doit désormais répondre à ces questions : quelles données avez-vous sur moi ? Ai-je consenti à vous les donner ? Si oui, quand ? Les avez-vous partagées et ai-je donné mon consentement pour ce partage ? Pourtant, loin d’être un frein, le RGPD met en place un cadre à la collecte de données à vocation médicale ». De la même façon qu’un compteur électrique intelligent peut analyser vos consommations et en déduire vos habitudes alimentaires (utilisation de plaques ou d’un micro-ondes par exemple), l’usage d’un store électrique peut informer sur le sommeil d’une personne.</p>
<p>Créée en 2012, Pryv, société indépendante qui œuvre dans le domaine de la santé numérique, développe un logiciel permettant de répondre aux besoins technologiques de la télémédecine et de la e-Santé, au cadre réglementaire du RGPD, ainsi qu’aux contraintes internationales, voire très locales comme le comité d’éthique d’un hôpital peut le demander. « Notre solution est utilisée pour développer des services mettant en œuvre des applications mobiles ou des appareils connectés, elle accélère le travail de nos clients et permet de travailler sur des fondations robustes, de leur phase de prototypage jusqu’à la mise à disposition sur le marché auprès de millions de personnes. » Les risques ? Premièrement, ce serait de ne pas exploiter la donnée alors qu’elle a beaucoup de valeur aussi bien pour l’individu, la médecine que pour la société entière. Deuxièmement, ce serait de mal l’exploiter, par exemple en biaisant le consentement ou en anonymisant les données, ce qui fait perdre le lien avec le patient. Enfin , les risques liés à la sécurité, le vol de données ou encore le piratage, existent.</p>
<p>En essor, Pryv poursuit son développement tout en nouant des partenariats avec des hébergeurs de données de santé (HDS), des sociétés de conseil en RGPD, et des sociétés qui développent des logiciels pour des clients tiers. « Notre ambition ? C’est apporter à nos clients tous les outils nécessaires pour devenir tiers de confiance dans la gestion de la vie privée de leurs clients. Leur enjeu est, à l’instar des banques qui doivent gérer l’argent selon la volonté de leurs clients, de gérer les données de l’individu selon sa volonté » conclut Pierre-Mikael Legris.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lausanne, 21 August 2018 &#8211; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv, the leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, today announced a </span><a href="https://www.rodanotech.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">milestone partnership with RodanoTech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the leading Swiss-based CRO specialised in clinical data management services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collaboration includes the development of an innovative clinical data management solution providing a comprehensive picture of each patient’s journey &#8211; one which combines patient reported outcome (PRO) data with clinical records collected by healthcare professionals. The platform is designed to meet the unique needs of the investigational research as well as the post approval market, including phase IV studies, registries and online medical communities.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><b><i>Patient relevant outcome measures</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are a proven necessity to assess the efficiency, effectiveness and personalization of clinical trials” said </span></i><b><i>Samir Mechati, CEO at RodanoTech</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “It supplements existing clinical data, increases treatment adherence and provides important insight about how patients are doing between medical visits”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The patient data set is expanding from the high-quality information collected in the clinical protocol to the more private data collated from wearables, mobile apps and in-home clinical devices. By streamlining the collection and integration of this dataset,<strong> t</strong></span><b>he joint Pryv/RodanoTech solution ensures a real-time connection with the patient health &#8211; capturing insightful data measured and influenced outside the four walls of the clinical setting.</b></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Real time, real world data that can be captured in patients’ daily lives is a powerful tool to optimise clinical research” said Pierre-Mikael Legris CEO at Pryv “</span></i><b><i>Our platform will not only capture patient data but will also give participants a view on their own trial dataset, sending a strong message of transparency and inclusivity which can turn them truly engaged</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”.</span></i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patient consent is a critical process that has historically been highly inefficient and prone to error. <strong>The joint Pryv/RodanoTech platform optimises that additional level of security between participants and clinical trial sites. Its greatest value comes from its dynamic, fine-grained consent and re-consent capability which gives patients the trust, transparency and control they require from clinical trials.</strong> The platform logs all authorizations, including the ‘contract’ between the patient and the investigator, for compliance oversight as mandated by GCP guidelines and privacy regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RodanoTech and Pryv offer tailored solutions to conduct projects of any size, from small Phase I studies to large scale trials involving sophisticated designs and long-term follow-up across clinical settings and geographies. Our Academic offer begins with a “get started&#8221; costing for proof of principles and goes to a premium packaged solution for large scale clinical trials. </span></p>

The integration of Pryv.io is designed to meet the increasing demands from customers and regulatory body for more transparent and trustworthy management of sensitive personal information. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HealthyHealth encourages healthy behavior through algorithms and research data predicting people’s risk for medical conditions based on their lifestyle data. By using their services, people can take better care of their health, employers can nurture a healthier workforce while insurers can better engage their customers, personalise their services (offer lower premiums) and reduce liabilities.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Pryv gives us the required privacy rigour to build and maintain the trust critical for our continued success” says Etienne Bourdon, COO at HealthyHealth. &#8220;With an estimated 600’000 data points collected annually per person, we embedded a middleware technology that not only strengthens GDPR compliance but also scales our collection, use, and storage of lifestyle information.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connected health and P4 medicine (Predictive, Preventive, Personalised, Participatory) is a reality nowadays. Sensor technology, wearable devices and mobile apps are helping individuals monitor their health and alerting them to any early signs of illness. With lifestyle data, innovative players are developing value propositions that help insurers and businesses alike understand behavioural trends and score risk in a more granular way. Responsible P4 players are integrating privacy into their propositions to reinforce regulatory compliance, boost customer confidence and thereby increase engagement. Pryv.io streamlines compliance efforts and scales the process of collecting lifestyle data so that businesses can more efficiently perform risk calculations, offer personalised plans and optimise customer service.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“HealthyHealth is at the forefront of InsurTech innovation” says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv.  &#8220;Our partnership exemplifies a strong technology collaboration that unlocks the value of lifestyle data with behavioural analytics and an unwavering commitment to data privacy, protection and GDPR compliance”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pryv</a> helps organisations manage personal data from creation, to use, to sharing and enhanced GDPR rights such as transparency, portability and right-to-be-forgotten.

Packaged for rapid integration, the software solution comes with a secure storage vault, encryption protocols, fine-grained consent management and comprehensive auditing capability that radically cut IT development costs and accelerate time-to-benefit while addressing most stringent data protection requirements.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HealthyHealth.uk Ltd is a company specialised in assessing precise individual health risks, with the ability to predict percentage risks for more than 800 medical conditions, hospitalisation and mortality. Using this data, a second product focuses on preventing the detected health risks by transforming digital data collected into prevention opportunities with a daily personalised plan including nutrition recommendations, physical and mental exercises. HealthyHealth is working with several (re-)Insurers, Employers and Hospitals internationally with two products : a B2B risk API for medical risk evaluation, and a B2B2C mobile App for end-users preventing detected risks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information, please <a href="mailto:contact@healthyhealth.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">send them an email</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or <a href="https://www.healthyhealth.uk/?utm_source=Referral&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Pryv%20%20Partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visit HealthyHealth website</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lausanne, Switzerland, June. 15, 2018 &#8212; Pryv, the leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, today announced a milestone partnership with </span><b>Interpolation, one of the leading IoT Platform in Asia </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(www.nocxx.com) enabling an end-to-end management of Industrial IoT solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new partnership is set to benefit customers in Japan, Thailand and the Philippines with an IoT platform-as-a-service offering meeting the highest levels of data safety, privacy and user empowerment. Both companies share vision that privacy is not an obstacle to business innovation but a competitive advantage when implemented correctly. This partnership will broaden the availability of </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/www/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to customers in Asia Pacific and enhance the way they cope with sensitive data collection and utilization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a second phase, both companies intend to extend collaboration to Europe.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our partnership with Pryv aligns with our strategy to deliver best-of-breed IoT solutions that increase customer efficiency, productivity and quality of service&#8221; said Michiaki Satate, CEO at Interpolation. “Along our extensive experience in IoT and End-to-end solutions, we capitalize on Pryv’s expertise in data protection to design solutions that make the most of IoT connectivity while addressing markets’ strict regulation compliance, interoperability needs, and privacy concerns&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses on the leading edge of data collection and usage are realizing that they will not be able to continue their existing business model without protecting consumers&#8217; privacy. As data privacy increases in importance in Asia, Interpolation saw an opportunity to partner with one of the most rigorous privacy &amp; data protection solution provider to deploy a platform where connectivity, secure personal data storage, consent management and compliance software is combined to offer businesses a comprehensive managed privacy service that improve </span><a href="https://www.clarip.com/data-privacy/gdpr-transparency-requirements/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transparency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and user control regarding data privacy. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are pleased to welcome Interpolation to our partner network,&#8221; said Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv &#8220;The partnership capitalizes on the unique strengths of each entity; Pryv brings the power of its rigorous Privacy software capability to one of the most established and well respected IoT technology solutions providers in Asia Pacific; Intepolation complements this by bringing the benefits of its expert services and long-term relationships with customers in Asia to Pryv.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its initial phase, the partnership will address the privacy and IoT connectivity imperatives in Industrial and healthcare sectors where service providers are looking at keeping up with evolving regulations and protecting data privacy.</span></p>
