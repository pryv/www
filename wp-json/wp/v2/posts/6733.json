Yet we use technology more than ever before. Every single day, millions of applications are being downloaded and fed by personal data. Whoever knows what it is being used for. We have been promised to be protected. We have heard &#8220;privacy-by-design&#8221; many times now, but have we understood it? Probably we did not. As we are still being deceived-by-design by many applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet things are supposed to have changed. &#8220;Businesses took actions&#8221;, we wish to believe&#8230; And some of them really did. The problem, however, is that we see the majority of companies only partially resolving the personal data management and privacy compliance challenges. Whereas according to the GDPR, privacy should be embedded in every aspect of personal data collecting apps.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting from the very beginning of establishing the relationship between the two parties, through the part that is visible for the users: the UI.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>The Beauty and the Beast in UI: Privacy-by-design or Deceived-by-design?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UI Design is a big part of today\u2019s software applications. More than a pretty look, it is what allows companies to interact with their users and guide them through their app. In terms of compliance, it is also what allows them to ask for users\u2019 consent and provide their users with the means to execute their rights to privacy. Which is why companies should be careful not to include marketing practices that go against privacy requirements when building their designs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, while we often speak about user-experience and user-engagement, we rarely discuss the \u201cdark patterns\u201d: the tricks used in UI designs to make users do things online that they would normally not do. Have you ever heard about them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dark patterns are the tricks that make you:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8230;Consent to things that you are not even aware of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8230;Share more information about you that you really want to, an action that became popular as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@mohityadav0493\/privacy-zuckering-deceiving-your-privacy-by-design-d41b6263b564\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPrivacy Zuckering\u201d.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8230;Pay for things you didn\u2019t even want to buy in the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.europeandatajournalism.eu\/eng\/News\/Data-news\/Dark-patterns-born-to-mislead\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dark Patterns Examples<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whichever it is, it is highly probable that you have been deceived-by-design many times already. The problem is: while UI design can be used to nudge people into making the best choices for themselves, it can also be used to deceive them into sharing more of their personal data than they would usually like to. But what is the \u201cright\u201d choice for the user?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Nudging users into making the \u00ab right \u00bb decisions<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If personal data collecting apps aren\u2019t easy to implement in terms of compliance, they certainly aren\u2019t easy to design in this regard as well. Practically: how to strike the right balance between best marketing practices and data privacy regulations?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>When persuasion becomes manipulation.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the GDPR poses legal frontiers to nudge companies into making the \u201cright\u201d choice for their users, recent studies show that they still have a hard time going against their own business interest especially at a time when data brokerage shows to be a particularly profitable business. Yet, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pryv.github.io\/www\/2020\/07\/23\/data-monetization-how-to-profit-from-rightfully-managing-personal-data\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there are other ways to monetize personal data<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and even based on a privacy-approach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some pathways and actions are more enticing than others. Of course, it can be fun to use gamification techniques to make an App more appealing and increase users\u2019 engagement, but some lines shouldn\u2019t be crossed. Especially when speaking of mobile health applications. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/privacyinternational.org\/news-analysis\/3986\/mental-health-site-sharing-your-personal-data-were-going-after-them\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mental health-websites that sell personal data, such as the results of depression tests, to 3rd parties &#8211; such as the case with Doctissimo<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Is it game over? Take it to the next level: Dark Patterns for good<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Light the way. Dark patterns might be properly used. We have seen\u00a0 typical \u2018dark\u2019 patterns, being used for the right reasons, for example in Open Banking. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.prototypr.io\/ethically-evil-how-to-use-dark-ux-patterns-for-good-e0af1e0443c9\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethically Evil: how to use dark patterns for good\u00a0<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the question remains: how to strike the right balance between best marketing practices and data privacy regulations?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is all about a shift in Mindset: Achieving privacy should not be seen as a problem, but rather as the goal. So <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pryv.github.io\/www\/2020\/01\/23\/consent\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make trust your first priority!<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And next time you need to implement a new design for your app, start with \u201cwhat\u201d not \u201cwhy\u201d, and ask yourself: what is the goal of this application and how to ensure privacy-by-design, turning it into your winning ticket? You\u2019ll be surprised what you can come up with!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Welcome to Privacy-as-a-State-of-Mind: We had a hand in.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For us at Pryv, achieving privacy is not about resolving compliance, it is the goal: privacy as a norm. As a back-end privacy provider, we can certainly help businesses collecting personal data to embed privacy into their systems, ensuring that the data they are collecting is consented rightly, managed and stored, compliantly. Yet, this is just one side of the coin. Companies have to meet us halfway to build a fully privacy-by-design, compliant solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pryv.com<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pryv.github.io<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/pryv\/open-pryv.io\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">github.com\/pryv\/open-pryv.io<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yours,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelina &amp; Stephanie<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sources:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.darkpatterns.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.darkpatterns.org\/<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/hellofuture.orange.com\/en\/what-are-dark-patterns-and-their-impacts-on-personal-data\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/hellofuture.orange.com\/en\/what-are-dark-patterns-and-their-impacts-on-personal-daa\/<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/slack-redir.net\/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdarkpatterns.org%2Ftypes-of-dark-pattern.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/darkpatterns.org\/types-of-dark-pattern.html<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/slack-redir.net\/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fprivacyinternational.org%2Fnews-analysis%2F3986%2Fmental-health-site-sharing-your-personal-data-were-going-after-them\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/privacyinternational.org\/news-analysis\/3986\/mental-health-site-sharing-your-personal-data-were-going-after-them<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/90452333\/why-you-still-cant-escape-dark-patterns\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/90452333\/why-you-still-cant-escape-dark-patterns<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/securityboulevard.com\/2018\/12\/dark-patterns-stealth-ways-companies-collect-personal-data\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/securityboulevard.com\/2018\/12\/dark-patterns-stealth-ways-companies-collect-personal-data\/<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fil.forbrukerradet.no\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/2018-06-27-deceived-by-design-final.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/fil.forbrukerradet.no\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/2018-06-27-deceived-by-design-final.pdf<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@mohityadav0493\/privacy-zuckering-deceiving-your-privacy-by-design-d41b6263b564\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/medium.com\/@mohityadav0493\/privacy-zuckering-deceiving-your-privacy-by-design-d41b6263b564<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.europeandatajournalism.eu\/eng\/News\/Data-news\/Dark-patterns-born-to-mislead\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.europeandatajournalism.eu\/eng\/News\/Data-news\/Dark-patterns-born-to-mislead<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dark Patterns in Action: Privacy-by-design or Deceived-by-design?
