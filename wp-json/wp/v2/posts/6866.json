Instead, thanks to the advances made in the smartphone motion sensors and over 10 years of space research, patients can be diagnosed quickly or monitored remotely when they are discharged from the hospital. OKCARDIO in particular provides over six vitals parameters including breathing rate, heart rate and heart rate variability as well as exclusive cardiac strength and kinetic energy as signs of the mechanical and hemodynamic function.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cFor the cardiologist, it is essential to assess both the heart\u2019s rhythm function, and the mechanical function, which is usually done with echocardiography and lengthy examinations. Although there are many wearables for rhythm assessment, there is no such solution for the mechanical function assessment of the heart. Being able to provide a complete overview of the cardiac function with a simple smartphone is ground-breaking. Using Pryv.io technology, we can ingest different types of high frequency data streams concurrently and efficiently, without compromising on privacy and security.\u201c &#8211; says Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Migeotte, CEO at HeartKinetics.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>HeartKinetics presents two solutions, the OKCARDIO<sup>TM<\/sup> smartphone app that measures myocardial activity through the smartphone\u2019s motion sensors, accelerometers and gyroscopes, which, when placed on the chest, can record myocardial contraction efforts and rhythm. The second one, \u201cthe KINO<sup>TM<\/sup>\u201d portable device, is a medical device made of two units, one of which is placed on the chest and the other on the lower back. After an initial calibration by a cardiologist, patients can take measurements at home in less than two minutes and transmit them for diagnosis via a smartphone or tablet. This provides an accurate assessment of both mechanical and electrical myocardial functions, together with hemodynamic parameters.\u00a0 Based on the patient\u2019s consent, captured and managed by Pryv.io technology,\u00a0 KINO can frequently share information about a patient\u2019s cardiac health status with their healthcare teams \u00a0which is essential for the management of heart failure.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>People living with cardiovascular disease have been among those affected the most during the pandemic. It became clear that there is an urgent need to bring remote monitoring solutions for performing cardiac function tests at home. HeartKinetics addresses such a need with an easy-to-use, breakthrough, scientific-proven technology, already tested and validated, that makes remote heart monitoring possible in a quick and efficient way, from the comfort of the patient&#8217;s home. In addition, patients can easily communicate with their physicians and share their data confidently among medical teams with full respect of the data privacy.<\/em>&#8221; says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv SA.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Preserving privacy in remote health is not a miracle, but the way to be: Pryv.io\u2019s privacy by design technology provides a robust, secure and consent-based backend solution that is designed to prove this. Moreover, the Pryv and HeartKinetics collaboration confirms that it is possible to empower doctors and patients with a deep respect for the confidentiality of the data.<\/p>\n<p>The combination of HeartKinetics health innovation and Pryv.io privacy technology brings light to a critical issue in a time of emerging need. It provides a sustainable, pandemic-proof healthcare solution that is aligned with stringent data privacy requirements.<\/p>\n<p>The KINO device has already been used in clinical trials in the Netherlands Germany and Belgium. OKCARDIO is in its final stage of clinical validations and will be available in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more about the Privacy-Preserving Home Cardiac Monitoring Solution by visiting <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.heartkinetics.com\">www.heartkinetics.com<\/a> &amp; www.okcardio.com<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>About HeartKinetics<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>HeartKinetics builds the cardiac remote monitoring solutions for the smart hospitals of the future.
