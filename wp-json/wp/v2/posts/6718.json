Really?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Privacy and data monetization are often seen as two antagonistic concepts. While the privacy-respect represents something that costs time, resources and money, the data monetization on the contrary, is what allows you to bring money <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Thus, when thinking about a successful strategy for bringing economic value to personal data, most companies only think of this data as an asset, and tend to forget about their responsibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, with regards to privacy and data protection regulations, personal data is certainly more a company\u2019s liability: a duty to comply with a large number of obligations. But what if you could turn these obligations into an opportunity for your company?<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Challenges of rightfully monetizing personal data<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data Monetization is a top priority for any company who makes it its business to collect personal data &#8211; <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">if you want to keep your business afloat, you have to generate money. That\u2019s clear.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, at an age dominated by the freeware business model, thinking of a way to bring economic value to this data while respecting users\u2019 privacy is a real challenge, many would say: how to motivate your users to pay for a service they can have for free elsewhere? Or if free, how to make profits without (unethically) selling their personal data?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it became obvious that selling raw personal data is a very profitable business, there are actually a lot of other ways for companies to monetize their data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, you can use it to reduce your costs and enhance your overall business efficiency. Second, you can use it to keep generating more money: not a surprise, but how to do that with respect to users\u2019 privacy rights? Usually, it is there that the conflict between money and privacy arises.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Using Data Privacy to enhance Data Monetization<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thing is, reducing data to money will often blind you about its infinite possibilities. In fact, chances are: starting by addressing data privacy issues will even help you enhance your data monetization strategy. Why is that?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a first step, you need to realize that just like money, data continuously flows in and out of organisations. And how do you make more money with your actual money? By selling more of your products and services? Sure. But mostly, by having a clear picture of how money runs into your organisation and acting smartly on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar way, having a clear picture of your data economy will allow you to be smart about it. You might think of it as an extra task that you don\u2019t want to put your efforts into. But actually, it will demand nothing more that you already have to do: as sorting your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pryv.com\/2020\/01\/27\/data-lifecyle-management\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">personal data lifecycle<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the core part of building your data privacy strategy (which you will have to do to comply with data protection regulations like GDPR).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, just like you can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pryv.com\/2020\/01\/23\/consent\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">turn your GDPR consent-requirements into an opportunity to build trust with your customers and grow your business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you can turn your data privacy obligations as an opportunity to find new ways to efficiently monetize the personal data you collect, enabling you to solve two problems at once.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, so good. But how to build an efficient privacy-preserving data management solution that allows you to meet both your privacy requirements and data monetization goals?<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Here is our solution: <a href=\"http:\/\/pryv.io\">Pryv.io<\/a> &#8211; a ready-to-use Personal Data Management Platform as foundation to build a compliant, scalable and successful business model<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pryv.io is a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pryv.com\/2020\/01\/27\/data-lifecyle-management\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">personal data management solution<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that allows companies to rightfully collect, store, share and use personal and health data.
