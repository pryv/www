A hack, that can be disastrous for individuals, is just as harmful for businesses, who will face regulatory fines and damage to their reputation. Such threats can be minimized by implementing adequate privacy and security measures right from the very start. Protecting digital channels is invaluable on many levels, saves lives and prevents significant financial losses.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cSmartphones and tablets are the primary access point for both our personal and work life, and a valuable target for attackers,\u201d said Dr. Christian Schlaeger, Build38 CEO. \u201cBusiness agility provided by mobile devices will continue to drive adoption in the mobile health sector, even more now with the announced DiGA initiative of the German government.
