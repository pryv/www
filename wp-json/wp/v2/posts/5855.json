Scheduled to launch in Q1 of 2020, the eHealth solution allows patients to send relevant data directly to their doctor while scheduling an appointment. Patients can book appointments and complete online evidence-based health check-ups in the app. For doctors, umana can help manage their agenda, set online appointments and perform check-ups. Through all this, Pryv ensures that the patient-doctor relationship is built on a foundation of trust by integrating comprehensive consent management and secure data management capabilities.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>Dr. Damian Meli, Project lead at umana,<\/em><\/strong><em> said: \u201cThis partnership represents a further step in umana\u2019s journey to building the most user-centric patient-doctor communication tool to be integrated with the Swiss Electronic Health Record system. Comprehensive data protection and compliance with data management regulations are essential to our development. We chose Pryv because they share our belief that the confidentiality and privacy of our users is a top priority. The integration of the pryv.io software is designed to meet the increasing demands from patients and regulating authorities for more transparent and trustworthy methods for the management of personal data.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO and co-founder of Pryv SA<\/em><\/strong><em>, said: \u201cWe are proud to have been chosen by umana. It shows that they are committed to the increasing value of digitized content in healthcare. By working with some of the world\u2019s eHealth pioneers, like umana, Pyrv can accumulate reliable industry experience which we can deploy in our development and agile operating model. Not only has umana demonstrated that they value each patient, but they are also interested in building a relationship based on trust with them, which will surely foster more efficient digital communication between patients and healthcare providers.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Pryv\u2019s privacy-by-design approach promotes privacy and data protection compliance to guide patients\u2019 data security decisions throughout their experience with a tool such as umana. As healthcare organizations increasingly integrate personal data into their services and processes, they continuously encounter the challenges of compliance and the chances of a breach of private data. Unfortunately, the defense mechanisms are often added on to existing structures as an after-thought, or in some cases, ignored altogether despite the fact that they should be embedded into the foundation of the system.<\/p>\n<p>As an eHealth platform, umana aims to connect service providers, such as doctors or pharmacists, with their patients. The solution will allow for appointment booking, direct messaging, medication plans and, in the future, Swiss EPD \u2013 all regulated via one access point. For patients, umana will allow them to book appointments and share vital parameters and personal information with doctors through web and smartphone applications. Thanks to Pryv, this transparent exchange of private information will be compliant with GDPR and Swiss DPA regulations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About umana<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>umana is a new Swiss health platform that offers products and services for patients and doctors. As an international team of family doctors and engineers, we have used our expertise and creativity to reduce and optimize the wait time before a patient meets with their healthcare provider. The booking tool can be easily integrated into any practice and makes consultations more streamlined and more pleasant for patients.
