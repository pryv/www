The two Swiss trust-tech companies are jointly pursuing strategic opportunities as part of their growth strategies.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Businesses operating in highly regulated markets such as healthcare, insurtech, mobility and fintech collect, use, and store sensitive personal data at scale. They must therefore adopt the highest privacy and security standards to ensure that data remains protected throughout the full lifecycle and across all three states of data: data at rest, in transit and in use. The need for secure data management has spawned a new era of data protection and privacy regulation and practices including: GDPR; Swiss DPA; CCPA, PIPEDA. And more stringent regulation will follow.<\/p>\n<p>Organizations face regulatory constraints at many stages of software design and must make decisions on how best to manage access control rights, provide data auditing capabilities and store \/ host data. \u00a0As more organisations and entire industries embrace the collection of personal data and its processing, they too will become subject to highly stringent regulations.<\/p>\n<p>While the collection and use of personal data has become increasingly mainstream, only few organisations have invested in reliable data management and storage solutions that provide the necessary security and privacy. Most organisations remain without protection. The risk is not only a potential fine of 20M EUR or more, but also losing the trust of users. Once lost, user trust and an organisations reputation are very hard to regain. To avoid this, it is imperative to work with the right privacy and security tools.<\/p>\n<p>The Pryv.io Personal Data &amp; Privacy Management Software allows businesses to build digital solutions that can collect, store, share and rightfully use personal data. It comes with must-have consent and auditing tools to keep the clients compliant with existing and forthcoming regulations.<\/p>\n<p>The ARCA solution leverages certified hardware to secure data in use, enabling sensitive data to be processed inside a trusted execution environment. In this way, data can be processed without exposing it to the rest of the system, reducing exposure of sensitive data and providing greater control and transparency for users. Its main advantage is the ease of integration as it is compatible with modern virtualization tools that software developers use, including Docker, Kubernetes, VMWare. The solution can be deployed in centralized, decentralized and distributed architectures.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Pierre-Mikael Legris<\/strong>, CEO at Pryv SA said: \u201cBy combining ARCA and Pryv.io, companies will blend best of breed security and privacy- by-design technologies for their backend and enhance trust for their customers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Florian Wiedmann<\/strong>, Secure Analytics Manager at CYSEC commented: \u201cOrganisations looking to comply with increasingly stringent data regulation require a one-stop solution for all their data security and management needs. Teaming up with Pryv will allow us to achieve this goal: A solution that offers both security and critical data management tools to allow organisations to achieve compliance easily.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Trust is critical for companies that manage personal data. Combining ARCA&#8217;s security and Pryv.io&#8217;s privacy by design technology provide a robust, secure and consent-based backend to achieve trust. The integration of Pryv.io and ARCA provides businesses with an easy to deploy solution to collect, structure, share, use and store personal and sensitive data without compromising on security and compliance. ARCA and Pryv.io are further integrated with <a href=\"https:\/\/build38.com\/the-trusted-application-kit\/\">TAK by Build38.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>About Pryv<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Pryv makes essential software for data-driven healthcare innovation.
