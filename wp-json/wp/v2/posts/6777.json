Digital Health, Fintech, Insurtech companies that are providing behaviour-based services and solutions are just a few that are trending among them. Prior to investing, however, investors need to know that these enterprises are worth the risk. In the context of personal data-fueled businesses, this means ensuring that their portfolio companies will not hit the wall due to poor data management and misuse of the data.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h3><b>Beyond the market-product fit. Details that matter.<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investors focus their attention on verifying the product-market fit and rightly so. Equally they look at the power of innovation, team execution capacity and specific technology components, such as AI to unlock the data capacity. However, (excluding those specialized in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/news\/almost-10b-invested-in-privacy-and-security-companies-in-2019\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PrivacyTech<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example), verifying the scalability in managing data and privacy rightly is rarely on the top of investors\u2019 minds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Still, a company\u2019s ability to properly manage its data can tell you a lot about its future. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while you are not expected to become the new privacy experts in town, evaluating certain data management criteria should help you ensure that these companies are managing the personal data they collect rightly, compliantly to relevant privacy regulations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Asking the right questions to get the right answers:<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are only 3 Questions away to de-risk when investing in personal data-fueled businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Checklist:<\/b><\/h4>\n<h4><b>#1 Does the company embed a privacy-first approach in the company mind-set and product design?\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting the situation: the GDPR, CCPA and numerous changes that are being made into existing data protection regulations are a sign that most companies still are behind when it comes to embedding privacy into their digital applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside the rising concerns around companies\u2019 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/8\/3\/21353232\/twitter-ftc-fine-misused-email-phone-advertising-2011-settlement\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">misuse of the data<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the current shift in users\u2019 tolerance with regard to the disrespect for their privacy needs to be addressed. In a &#8220;user-first&#8221; world, lacking trust results in poor business offerings, limited access and less data sharing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No valuable data for a data-fueled business means <\/span><b>no return in investment for an investor.<\/b><\/p>\n<h4><b>#2 Does the company master its personal data lifecycle: from collection, structure, storage, sharing and deletion?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mastering <a href=\"https:\/\/pryv.github.io\/www\/2020\/01\/27\/data-lifecyle-management\/\">the personal data lifecycle<\/a> is what allows companies to have a proper oversight of what is happening within their organization in terms of data. For a data-driven enterprise, this is today an absolute necessity; first in regard to compliance, but also for everything else:<\/span><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does the organization precisely understand what EXACT VALUE the collected data already brings to the organization so that they can build an efficient data monetization strategy?<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does their system have interoperability capabilities to allow easy integration and manage diverse data-sets? Can it SCALE over time?<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do they properly address all the current regulatory requirements? Are they ready to ADAPT to forthcoming changes?<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before investing, be sure to ask your prospective companies these few questions to ensure that they master how the personal data they collect is managed throughout their organization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Usually, it is a good indicator that they are ready to scale overtime and thrive in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cpomagazine.com\/data-privacy\/the-rise-of-the-privacytechs\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the \u201cTechs\u201d-era<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>#3 Does their technology allow for privacy-preserving globalization?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, legal interoperability is nothing less but a necessity to scale up any data-driven business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet with the multiplication of privacy laws and related obligations as regards to <a href=\"https:\/\/pryv.github.io\/www\/2020\/08\/03\/data-residency-insights-on-where-to-store-the-personal-data-you-collect\/\">data residency<\/a>, growth in user base and new partnerships that imply for the data to be transferred somewhere new are only a few among the multiple scenarios that make it particularly difficult for a data privacy unconscious business to adapt afterwards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A privacy-preserving globalization approach will help ensure that<a href=\"https:\/\/pryv.github.io\/www\/2020\/01\/23\/consent\/\"> business growth opportunities won\u2019t turn into an issue, but a success.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Why is privacy important ?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nowadays, privacy is not about compliance only. Privacy is about data ethics, business values, and how much trust you can put into a company that collects and processes personal data.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Investment is(n\u2019t) blind.<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like in love, a long-lasting relationship does not rely on first-sight, but trust. As you probably wouldn&#8217;t marry someone that you don\u2019t trust, we bet you wouldn\u2019t want to invest in a business you have doubts about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the same logic, when investing in a data-fueled business, better ask yourself before moving further: Would you be the one to trust this business with your family personal data?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We hope the checklist above will help you make the right choices for profitable investments.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Opt-in with Pryv<\/b><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is any of your portfolio companies struggling to meet new data protection requirements or embed privacy into their digital solutions?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you want to ensure that the companies you perform due-diligence on will not fail on managing their data rightly?
