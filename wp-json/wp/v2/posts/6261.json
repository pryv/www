But in doing so, a number of organizations are failing at organizing their data lifecycle. First, it is not a simple task: it\u2019s a blend of legal, IT and business-logic actions which need to be designed to meet current data and regulatory requirements, as well as to last over time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, very often, while focusing too much on the data processing stage, organizations forget about the importance of carefully managing the data at all of its stages, which can rapidly become an issue.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data without proper management can not only create privacy and security gaps, but also position the entire operations of the company at risk.
