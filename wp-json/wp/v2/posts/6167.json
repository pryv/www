Telemedicine and digitization are becoming the new normal. Funding options are increasing to push back the barriers of digital health innovation. While the Germans were already known for their robust and above-average effective healthcare system, the DHA will now make their healthcare market more attractive than ever, unleashing countless new opportunities for digital health startups and innovators. But how do you conquer such a market?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#1 What you need to know to successfully scale-up your digital health innovation in Germany<\/span><\/h2>\n\n<h4><b><i>The German Healthcare Market &#8211; Overview<\/i><\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the largest European healthcare system counting 72 million insured citizens, Germany has always been a very attractive market for health actors, not only for internal players, but also globally. However, until now, breaking into the digital health market was legally more challenging than rewarding, making it very difficult for health startups and entrepreneurs to pioneer into the German eHealth scene. It all changes now with the adoption of the Digital Healthcare Act.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b><i>The Digital Healthcare Act &#8211; What\u2019s new?<\/i><\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Digital Healthcare Act was adopted in 2019 by the German Parliament and entails the new rules to support digital health innovation in Germany. If the German healthcare system was strong thus far, it was also filled with paperwork and not legally welcoming in regard to digital innovation. The new Act addresses these issues and opens the German healthcare market to a new era of digitization and unlimited possibilities for groundbreaking eHealth solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting from January 2020, the Act will bring revolutionary changes to the German Healthcare Community, opening the doors to infinite opportunities for the visionary eye. Among them:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Full digital transformation of the healthcare system;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Telemedicine becoming the new normal;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctors prescribing Apps as a Treatment.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><b><i>Pioneering Health Data &#8211; Laws to follow?<\/i><\/b><\/h4>\n<p><b><i><br \/>\n<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the many possibilities that the DHA offers, unleashing the power of digitization over healthcare involves a lot of risks for personal health data and patients. Companies that are taking the leap into pioneering health data will have to comply with several standards and Regulations in order to ensure that patients are safe and data are secured.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regulatory framework on top of your new eHealth Solution will be composed of:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EU Regulations: mostly <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pryv.github.io\/www\/2019\/11\/20\/gdpr-swiss-dpa-e-privacy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GDPR <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pryv.github.io\/www\/2020\/02\/25\/get-your-mdr-compliance-done-right-explained-in-3-minutes\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MDR<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, ensuring data protection and product safety.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">German Data Protection laws: specifying data protection over GDPR.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laws deriving from the DHA itself: like the Patient Data Protection Law that is in motion or the DiGA Ordinance if you were targeting to prescribe a Digital Health App (DiGA).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medical Professional Secrecy.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is worth highlighting that Data Protection Standards within the German healthcare system are extremely strict.

By making Digital Health Apps (\u201cDiGA\u201d in DHA) a treatment, the new Act establishes a right for eHealth Solutions to be prescribed and reimbursed by insurance companies: providing start-ups with the opportunity to re-think and introduce new business models to support their growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b><i>Your Digital Health Solution &#8211; Eligible under DHA?<\/i><\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, not every digital health application will be eligible to become such a care treatment.

Precisely, they will have to apply to the competent authority and show that their products meet specific General Requirements (including those of GDPR and MDR) and will have \u201cpositive care effects\u201d, not only for individuals, but also for medicine and the healthcare system itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Fast Track Process:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> After a 3-months preliminary period for application review, the BfArM (which is the German Authority that reviews for DiGA applications) will approve temporarily (or not) the product for a 1-year testing period, during which the producers will have to demonstrate the \u201cpositive care effects\u201d of their solution in order to be definitively listed in the DiGA directory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes this process particularly interesting for digital health startups is that it is indeed very fast and allows for rapid business growth and evolution:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Requests for listing in the DiGA directory are reviewed in a 3-months approximate period, enabling rapid startup evolution if things go well!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pre-listing is allowed during a one year testing period, so that companies have time to prove positive medical efficiency while having their products on the market.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Price negotiations are also in order if the testing period is proven to be successful.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6207\" src=\"https:\/\/pryv.github.io\/www\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Pryv-DiGa-Draft-Design-EG-v3-1-600x338.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https:\/\/pryv.github.io\/www\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Pryv-DiGa-Draft-Design-EG-v3-1-600x338.png 600w, https:\/\/pryv.github.io\/www\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Pryv-DiGa-Draft-Design-EG-v3-1-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/pryv.github.io\/www\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Pryv-DiGa-Draft-Design-EG-v3-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/pryv.github.io\/www\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Pryv-DiGa-Draft-Design-EG-v3-1.png 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#3 Be the first among equals: conquer the new German\u00a0<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">digital Healthcare market in a heartbeat<\/span><\/i><\/h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the specifics are still in the process of being defined, interested companies can and should already look for eligibility to ensure that they will be the first to benefit among many more to come and compete with. <\/span><b>We will never emphasize on this enough: Time matters.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if you wish for your product to be part of the short-listed portfolio in the beginning of DiGAs era, now is the time to apply and place your solution at the top of German eHealth innovation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b><i>Being first to last &#8211; requirements<\/i><\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the easy appearance of the fast-track process, Digital Health innovators will have to work hard to see their Applications accepted (at least temporarily) by the German authorities.
