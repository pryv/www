For companies, it means that the code is accessible for their developers, so they can verify how it works and make proof-of-concepts without having to pay for anything.<\/p>\n<p>Especially in the health sector, they are very popular as they tend to solve a lot of recurrent issues, like reducing development costs, interoperability and transparency.<\/p>\n<h4>(1)Transparency as a principle.<\/h4>\n<p>Today, personal data and digital health apps are becoming an indispensable tool of our society. Yet, because they tend to rely on the important collection of personal and health sensitive information, the concerns around their respect to privacy are at preeminent importance. So how to address these concerns efficiently?<\/p>\n<p>By relying on Open Source solutions, you show that you are not afraid to reveal how you manage the personal and health data you collect, and send a strong message of inclusivity which can truly make a difference as regards to your users&#8217; engagement.<\/p>\n<h4>(2) Fast, agile and reliable, at no cost.<\/h4>\n<p>If Open Source is the best solution to achieve transparency, it is also the best solution for startups and innovators who want to be fast, confident and build a compliant, scalable digital health app at a costless price.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, costless. This is certainly one of the primary benefits of relying on Open Source solutions: it costs you nothing. Which is extremely interesting for small businesses who might simply not have the resources to buy off-the-shelf solutions, but not only.<\/p>\n<p>Even if having the resources, you might be interested to make a proof-of-concept before going any further with a spotted solution. And this is definitely another primary benefit of Open Source solution: public accessibility.<\/p>\n<h4>(3) Community Validation: Trust-by-design<\/h4>\n<p>You are not alone.<br \/>\nIt is not only a small portion of people who have access to the code, but literally everyone. Which makes it trust-by-design and harder to corrupt as it relies on mutual surveillance and reviews from a very diversified community. But above all, it is an undeniable pledge of confidence for users in general.<\/p>\n<h4>(4) No dependencies.<\/h4>\n<p>Another great advantage of using an open source solution is that you have no dependencies with regards to the company which provides you with the solution. You are not tied to some proprietary code as you could be by using pure proprietary software.<\/p>\n<p>This is definitely a game changer for companies who always wanted to rely on existing off-the-shelf solutions to focus on their core business but couldn\u2019t risk to be tied to the hazards or change-of-mind of another business.<\/p>\n<h4>(5) Forward-looking: open possibilities.<\/h4>\n<p>Last but not least, open source is also one of the best strategies to ensure maintaining scalability and flexibility within your organization. With an open code, you will be less exposed to the risk of ending up with obsolete capabilities. Not to mention the fact that it will also encourage open collaboration between your development teams and providers, which can be the fast-tracker you were looking for for creativity and innovation.<\/p>\n<p>Check out how you can build a privacy-by-design digital health app with <a href=\"https:\/\/pryv.github.io\/www\/2020\/06\/08\/pryv-sa-releases-an-open-source-solution-for-personal-data-privacy-management\/\">Open Pryv.io<\/a>: a free, full production, easy-to-install open-source solution for the collection and management of sensitive personal and health data: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/pryv\/open-pryv.io\">https:\/\/github.com\/pryv\/open-pryv.io<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><em> Personal data and consent management, done rightly.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By now, you&#8217;ve probably all heard that Pryv.io, the Swiss-made personal data &amp; consent data management solution, is available Open Source.
