The use of digital tools for improving outpatient care is growing faster than ever. At the rise of the expected 4th Covid-19 wave the healthcare systems are exponentially investing in adopting telehealth solutions and providing remote care as a secure and trusted alternative of traditional care. Reasons for telehealth investments by hospitals are multiple. Telehealth solutions allow hospitals to ease the burden on nurses and doctors while being able to cater to more patients and even focusing on the patients most in need through better triage. Although there are already a number of remote care technologies, adoption for hospitals remains challenging as most of them are not approved medical devices, lack privacy compliance and thus cannot be integrated in the heavily regulated processes the healthcare system has put in place.<\/p>\n<p>To address this challenge and ensure a smooth workflow for physicians, caregivers and patients Sleepiz, the only medical grade (CE approved) contactless monitor and Pryv, a Swiss leader in privacy and patient data management solution provider, join efforts to bring a solution which not only meet the requirements of interoperability, easy and timely integration with the existing EHR, but delivers a ready-to-be-used platform for establishing trustful online communication with the patient. Sleepiz is the first healthcare company in Switzerland with ISO 277701 and ISO 27001 with certification of their system for data privacy and information security.<\/p>\n<p>Pryv.io is a privacy-centric middleware, used as a robust data management foundation to develop risk-controlled mHealth, eHealth, and InsurTech applications with confidence and in respect to IT and regulatory requirements. The solution is used to manage large and diverse streams of data coming from external platforms, wearable devices, EHR\/EMR and health record systems.<\/p>\n<p>This partnership will help hospitals move towards digitizing their infrastructure and integrating homecare monitoring seamlessly into their ecosystem.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Sleepiz:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sleepiz AG (Ltd.) is a Z\u00fcrich based startup with a mission to provide patient-centric disease management through seamless integration of contactless monitoring into people\u2019s homes.
