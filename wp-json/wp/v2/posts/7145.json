This new resource has been devised by experts from across the cancer community to support and advise people on their physical and mental wellbeing whilst undergoing cancer treatment. The app can also connect patients with not just local pharmacists in their area but also community pharmacists who have trained to become \u2018Community Cancer Champions.\u2019 Experts at the Royal Marsden Hospital, a world-leading cancer centre and teaching institution have helped to develop a practical, bite-size training curriculum for the community pharmacists who wish to become Community Cancer Champions. The training provides advice on how to talk to and assist cancer patients, particularly around managing symptoms and worries. Undergoing cancer treatment can be bewildering, with an array of advice and support available from many different sources. This has only been made worse during the COVID-19 pandemic, as cancer patients may have felt the need to avoid healthcare facilities, for fear of being put at greater risk of coming into contact with the virus.<\/p>\n<p>Unify Health aims to be an app that is always accessible, no matter whether it is night or day that provides cancer patients a toolkit of tailored advice and information with the ability to locate community pharmacists with training on the management of cancer symptoms. Confidentiality is central to development of trust between patient and healthcare professionals. Ensuring privacy can help promote more effective communication and promote public confidence in the platform.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cThe Pryv solution allowed us to underpin our application with a secure and compliant platform for data storage bringing the application to market more rapidly than had that element been developed bespoke. Regulatory compliance in terms of personal data was at the heart of what we were trying to achieve here. All personal data collected within the app is managed via the Pryv.io patient data governance software and no patient data leaves the relevant territories (i.e. UK patient data stays in the UK, EU patient data stays in the EU). Pryv comes with must-have consent and auditing tools to keep the platform compliant with existing and forthcoming regulations.Their team were always on hand to support us through the onboarding and implementation stages of the project.\u201d said Alex Williams, Head of Digital at Swordfish Advertising.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>About <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unifyhealth.app\/\">Unify Health<\/a>: Unify Health has been devised by experts from the healthcare industry working with hospitals,<br \/>\ncommunity pharmacists, clinicians, nurses, patient groups and charities to make support and advice more readily available to cancer patients.
