However, keeping a privacy-ensured direct communication channel between the patient and the researcher or the health professional is required for a number of remote monitoring solutions.\u00a0<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Medisant\u00e9 and Pryv join forces to combine the best of both worlds, thus making Remote Patient Monitoring simple and scalable while ensuring GDPR compliance out-of-the-box.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><em>Lausanne\/Lucerne, Switzerland, March 19th, 2020<\/em> \u2013 The Swiss leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, Pryv SA, and Medisant\u00e9 Group AG, the world&#8217;s leading provider of direct-to-cloud medical IoT infrastructure, announced a strategic collaboration.<\/p>\n<p>A simple and secure solution for remote monitoring of patients at home is ready to be implemented by any home-care service and healthcare facility, globally. The platform addresses the imperatives across the continuum of care: focusing on delivering seamless user experience, reliable health-metrics, and establishing a patient-to-care team relationship, without compromising on data privacy and digital ethics.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u00a0\u201dToday, more than ever, remote access to care is nothing less than an indispensable service. We are thrilled to be able to work with Medisant<\/em>\u00e9<em> products, which have been proven in delivering the unbeatable strength of accessibility, connectivity, and usability.&#8221; says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv. &#8220;Leveraging on Medisant<\/em>\u00e9\u2019s<em> zero-touch medical IoT infrastructure, we are determined to ushering remote patient monitoring and telecare where it is needed the most, to anyone, at any time\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Strengthening the adoption of innovative digital health solutions relies on two main pillars: usability and trust. The personal patient data is critical and highly sensitive- thus, undoubtedly, security and privacy are at the core of designing reliable medical-grade digital solutions. GDPR, MDR, national-specific regulations and reimbursement plans set up high entry barriers for medical IoT and digital healthcare providers, leaving them no choice but to comply. The regulations make it clear: \u00ab consent should be explicitly and freely given\u00bb. Moreover, any system provider should be able to offer an opt-out option at any given time.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cOur strategic partnership with Pryv offers a major added value to care organizations and CROs using our solution for Remote Patient Monitoring, as it allows them to guarantee data privacy. It also gives them top-grade tools to manage explicit consent to share patient data with the various stakeholders, such as health insurances in countries where reimbursement of RPM is dependent of a minimal number of measurements performed by the patient each month.\u201d \u2013 Gilles Lunzenfichter, CEO and Co-founder of Medisant\u00e9<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Harnessing the power of medical IoT devices allows keeping track of patients\u2019 health outside of the healthcare premises, drastically decreasing costs, optimizing resources and most importantly significantly improving the well-being and comfort of patients.<\/p>\n<p>Facilitating the care teams\u2019 daily operations while scaling up telemonitoring to millions of chronic and elderly patients is a reality now. Not tomorrow, but today.
