The new release addresses growing customer demand for mission-critical healthcare services with many devices connected. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne of the key challenges of IoT data streams is to handle high volumes of data with fast connectivity without compromising on security.\u201d says Stephan Bachofen, VP Software at Biovotion AG. \u201cPryv&#8217;s high throughput data ingestion will allow medical trackers to cope with future large volumes of telemetry data overcoming surges with guaranteed low-latency at affordable costs.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Healthcare industry remains among the fastest to adopt the Internet of Things. <\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Integrating IoT features into medical devices greatly improves the quality and effectiveness of service, bringing especially high value for the elderly people, patients with chronic conditions, and those requiring constant supervision. According to market estimates, spending on the Healthcare IoT solutions will reach 1 trillion Swiss francs by 2025 and will set the stage for highly personalised, accessible and on-time Healthcare services for everyone. Organisations need to ensure that future data conduits are powerful enough to handle and process the predicted throughput and increase in telemetry data, yet stay flexible enough to react to changing business needs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pryv provides a future-proof, device-ready privacy management solution handling personal data thru its lifecycle. IoT data arrives in the form of a continuous telemetric stream, is rapidly ingested, processed for authorisation and then optimally compressed in Pryv\u2019s personal data vault for sharing and analysis.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pryv&#8217;s purpose-built API is designed to ingest different types of high frequency data streams concurrently and efficiently. <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benchmarks performed on the beta release show notable improvements in throughput and storage density.<strong> On moderate virtualised hardware (4 cores, 14 GB RAM, 5000 IOPS), <\/strong><\/span><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/pryv.io\/\">Pryv.io<\/a> High Frequency stores 100\u2019000 measures per second at approximately one byte per measure. The new release uses several advanced data compression algorithms to optimise disk usage. With an average IoT device capturing 20 sensor values every second, a single 4 cores \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/pryv.io\/\">Pryv.io<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> machine is able to store the data produced by 2000\u00a0 concurrent devices.<\/strong> In a standard deployment, multiple machines would be receiving the telemetric streams in parallel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pryv helps organisations manage personal data from creation, to use, to sharing, archival and deletion. The High Frequency release is appropriate for health applications that require near real-time experience such as in physiology monitoring, critical home care services or point-of-care diagnostic. Our adaptive privacy out-of-box solution comes integrated with a secure storage vault, fine-grained consent management and comprehensive auditing capability that radical<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ly accelerate time-to-benefit while addressing most stringent data protection requirements.<\/span><\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lausanne, 20 March 2018 \u2013 Pryv, the leading provider of privacy and personal data management solutions, announced today Pryv.io High Frequency, a new software release capable of ingesting high-throughput IoT data at scale and [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[18,80],"tags":[33,96,56,57,55],"class_list":["post-4291","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-pryv-updates","category-topnews","tag-datamanagement","tag-features","tag-highfrequency","tag-iomt","tag-iot"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v24.0 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Pryv Unleashes IoT Connectivity with High Throughput Data Ingestion<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Ingesting high-throughput IoT data at scale and with optimal storage density.
