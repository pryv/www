We feel that we are complementary partners to address companies&#8217; needs regarding data privacy and its management, from the solution edition to its deployment, its setup. Our competencies allow us to even design and create bespoke applications for a full package.\u201d\u00a0 says Nicolas Roux, CEO at Agaetis.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 and Covid-19 undoubtedly accelerated digitization in any aspect of our lives, making a strong push over the technology tipping point at unimaginable speed. Companies have rapidly started developing digital platforms that process customers\u2019 personal data pumping great amounts of user data into their system: from digital health and remote monitoring of patients, education, infrastructure optimizations and consumer behaviour analysis in almost any industry one could think of. For each of these new digital offerings, there are a number of privacy pitfalls that if neglected will easily lead to very damaging results and loss of business. Meeting the highest privacy regulations became must-have priority for development teams.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solid, flexible, ready to use, here are some adjectives that perfectly describe why we trust the <\/span><\/i><a href=\"http:\/\/pryv.io\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pryv.io<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> solution. Perfect if you want to deploy a data framework managing data privacy, we figured out that it\u2019s still manageable to even adapt it to an existing data management solution, as we experience it with one of our projects. The easy-to-use and heavily documented open-source tool, as well as the good communication with the Pryv team, confirm our choice! We are convinced that we will use this privacy solution in our projects, of course in the healthcare field but we are confident that it could be deployed on others.&#8221;<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> says Nicolas Roux, CEO at Agaetis.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, to achieve winning digital transformation, technology is not enough on its own: understanding the relation between humans and technology is crucial to develop sustainable digital transformation. Often misunderstood, human-centric digitalization is not just about engaging UI and UX.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To deliver a truly human-centric digital experience, it is essential to focus on key concepts about exactly understanding user needs, so that benefits exceed the cost of sharing personal data. This is the first and most critical step on building trusted, long term relationships.\u201d says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv \u201cWe are very excited to collaborate with Agaetis: Passionate about innovative technology and cultivating collective intelligence, Agaetis integrates this cocktail into its productions.
