										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="http://pryv.com">Pryv</a> and <a href="https://www.cara.ch/fr/Accueil/Avec-CARA-restez-connecte-a-votre-sante.html">Cara</a> are the organizations in charge of the electronic patients records for the  SWISSNEUROREHAB project. Pryv.io software is a consent, privacy and data  management tool which is to be integrated by the HES-SO Valais team of Profs. Michael Schumacher, </strong><strong>Henning Müller, Jean-Paul Calbimonte</strong><strong> as co-investigators of the sub-project 3 “data infrastructure &amp; data capture”, and Prof. David Issom as coordinator of this sub-project, focusing on building an interoperable data platform.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> </strong>SWISSNEUROREHAB is one of the <a href="https://www.innosuisse.ch/inno/fr/home/actualites/media/nsb-news_list.msg-id-85523.html">fifteen projects selected </a> for this first edition of the Flagship initiative, started in 2021 by Innosuisse, the Swiss Agency for the Encouragement of Innovation, and intended to support interdisciplinary projects with high socio-economic value.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Through its vision, it aims at setting up an innovative model of neurological rehabilitation</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The project is developed and coordinated by the CHUV, aiming at implementing an innovative model of neurological rehabilitation. The project’s budget of 11.2M CHF Is provided by Innosuisse and by industrial partners.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>SwissNeuroRehab will develop and validate an effective model of neurorehabilitation along the continuum of care in Switzerland. This patient-centered model will specify the clinical, operational and economic processes required to offer the most efficient treatment of sensorimotor and cognitive deficits after stroke, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury. State-of-the-art, evidence-based therapeutic programs, leveraged by Digital Therapies, will be validated and implemented into the clinical routines by Swiss centers of excellence. An inter-cantonal economic model will validate the reimbursement of this new model within the healthcare system and estimate the return of investment for healthcare providers and MedTech companies. Novel education curricula and science dissemination programs will be built for healthcare professionals, decision makers, patients and caregivers. The model will offer a long-term solution to address the challenges due to the increasing prevalence of neurological disorders in our ageing society.</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Every year, in Switzerland, 15,000 people suffer from a stroke, 5,000 people suffer severe or moderate cerebral trauma (CCT) and 150 find themselves paraplegic. Neurorehabilitation takes care of these patients with interdisciplinary teams of physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, neuropsychologists, nurses and doctors, who work together to promote the recovery of walking, manual dexterity, speech, memory or concentration. Often, following a stroke or CBT, patients remain hospitalized in neurorehabilitation for months, with several therapeutic sessions a day. Hospital neurorehabilitation in Switzerland is among the most specialized and efficient in the world. However, after the patient returns home, ambulatory neurorehabilitation often remains insufficient and disconnected from hospital care. For practical reasons, such as being domiciled far from a neurorehabilitation center, but also for reasons related to insurance coverage, the follow-up of most patients is limited to a few therapeutic sessions per week instead of multi-daily sessions offered in hospitals. However, the frequency and intensity of the sessions are the main factors determining the success of neurorehabilitation and the degree of recovery. To overcome this problem, the consortium plans to develop and implement a new model of personalized neurorehabilitation. This model will include the best existing therapeutic options combined with innovative neurotechnological solutions such as neurostimulation, robotics, exoskeletons, sensors, video games and virtual reality. These new therapies will be available in the clinic, in the office, but also at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The development of a common and inter-cantonal data platform will make it possible to monitor and optimize neurorehabilitation processes throughout the patient&#8217;s journey from acute care to home. Experts in socio-economics are involved in the project with the aim of proposing a new repayment system defined in collaboration with insurers, including technological tools and tele-rehabilitation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The SWISSNEUROREHAB project brings together the main academic, clinical and industrial actors in Switzerland who has started collaboration to combine conventional neurorehabilitation approaches with new digital technologies, to offer personalized care to patients with sequelae of strokes, head injuries ands paraplegia.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The academic part includes, among others, the university hospitals in Lausanne, Bern, Geneva and Zurich, EPFL, ETH in Zurich, and SUVA clinics. Among the industrial partners are Hocoma, the world leader in the movement&#8217;s rehabilitation technologies, the Cara and Pryv companies working on the patient&#8217;s electronic file, the Lausanne unicorn start-up MindMaze and other neurotechnological start-ups.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In this project, coordinated by Professor Andrea Serino, the CHUV works closely with the Institution of Lavigny, as it already does as part of the new University Service of Neurorehabilitation (SUN). The outpatient part of the SUN was designed in the spirit of the Flagship project, by putting neurotechnologies for the benefit of Vaud patients requiring neurorehabilitation. The project will be a pillar of the new Interdisciplinary Research Center in Neuroplasticity and Neurorehabilitation (CRINN) implemented jointly by the CHUV, the University of Lausanne and the Institution of Lavigny as part of the SUN.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Thank you, cybernews.com for <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/evelina-georgieva-pryv-investing-in-data-privacy-is-not-only-about-fulfilling-a-requirement-to-achieve-compliance/">this great interview about Digital Trust, Consumer Privacy Awareness and where Pryv fits in.</a></b></p>
<p><b>Evelina Georgieva, Pryv: &#8220;investing in data privacy is not only about fulfilling a requirement to achieve compliance&#8221;</b></p>
<p><b><i>Today, everyone leaves a digital footprint on the Internet. Whether it’s when you visit a daily newspaper website or when you make online banking transactions. Unfortunately, not all companies put their primary focus on data privacy and that leaves enormous amounts of sensitive information at risk.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s essential that businesses would start seeing data privacy as an essential part of building trust and brand reputation rather than a tick-box to achieve compliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So </span><a href="https://cybernews.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybernews</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invited Evelina Georgieva, the Co-Founder and Business Development Officer at </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to discuss about modern personal data management solutions and how they can empower forward-looking companies.</span></p>
<p><b>How did the idea of Pryv originate? What has your journey been like?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv is a blend of ideas initiated more than 10 years ago. While overcoming leukemia, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/perki/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pierre-Mikael</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> got inspired to develop a solution that will empower patients to stay away from the hospital but still receive crucial monitoring and care remotely. At the same time, Frederic was eager to create a B2C digital place, Facebook-like but with privacy at focus to empower users to master their data sharing and protect their data ownership rights. Simon brought his digital ethics and privacy vision. I (Evelina) joined them when we pivoted from the B2C concept to create Pryv B2B as you know it today: a trusted software vendor of privacy and personal data management solutions. </span></p>
<p><b>Can you introduce us to your personal data management software? What are its key features?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We help organizations manage personal data from creation to use, sharing and disposal. Following the privacy engineering approach, we support our client’s IT teams to ensure that their data privacy compliance is done right: from the very early architecture design to the introduction of data-driven business models. We help them not only accelerate time to market but also cut IT development costs and speed up data utility and scalability across legal jurisdictions, such as the GDPR and industry-specific regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2015, we license our Pryv.io software which is used as a solid foundation to boost the development efforts of “integrated teams” of IT engineers, legal and business experts. The Pryv.io middleware acts as a “plumbing system” which ensures their digital platform has its best chances to engage customers and drive business values – covering the entire data lifecycle and the data privacy aspects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the bestseller features are the dynamic consent, extensible data model, decentralized storage for scalability, and data mapping for automatic integration with existing warehouses.</span></p>
<p><b>In your opinion, what data privacy issues should more people be concerned about?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is yet not clear enough that privacy and security are different. Unlike security, which nowadays is well understood by almost anyone, data privacy is still unclear. Privacy can be translated in different ways and have different meanings. While some will correlate it with limiting access to data, others, like us at Pryv, will look at data privacy as a tool to unlock data values. For us, privacy is not secrecy, but the ability of individuals to use their data, act on their rights and give informed consent for the rightful processing of this data. Thus, each stakeholder can win more from the unlimited power that personal and contextualized data can bring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My message to the users will be first to decide what privacy means to them and then take decisions and measure risks versus opportunities.</span></p>
<p><b>How do you think the recent global events affected your field of work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effect of the Covid pandemic, the growing power of information war, the upscaling Digital Democracy, and the rapidly changing Data Protection Regulations on a global scale, just to name a few, have been undoubtedly an eye-opening momentum for any forward-looking business. It became apparent that investing in data privacy is not only about fulfilling a requirement to achieve compliance but an imperative to build trust, protect brand reputation, and develop new revenue streams. </span></p>
<p><b>Some experts believe that keeping up to date with data privacy trends and requirements could even be the selling point for customers. Can you share some tips for businesses looking to update their privacy policy?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe that personal data aggregation, sharing, and processing should be as effective, secure, and trustworthy as online banking. This is a must-have to empower the user to understand the value of the data, how to manage and control it, and promote trust and engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this new paradigm, privacy is not a compliance tick-box but an opportunity to break data silos, differentiate products, and services and attract end-users with trust, transparency, and empowerment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We advise our customers to embed privacy-DNA in any process of their organizations, early in the development phase, ensure cross-functional team and privacy-engineering capabilities and thus guarantee they can deliver competitive user-attracting services and open up new horizons for achieving high ROI in a short period and overtime.</span></p>
<p><b>What dangers can customers be exposed to if a company they trust struggles to ensure compliance?</b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the obvious non-compliance and loss of brand reputation and trust, for many businesses, a data protection breach will mean a loss of business that could be as strong as pushing the business to bankruptcy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For users, understanding the trusted brand lacks privacy compliance might result in disappointment and disengagement, as well as pushing the individuals to act on their data rights (where is my data stored, prove me you have my consent and what so for, provide an audit on the data interactions, etc.) Incapacity to deliver will again result in impressively huge fines and serious business consequences.  </span></p>
<p><b>What are some of the worst mistakes companies tend to make when it comes to handling large amounts of customer data?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest mistakes in my opinion are the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undervaluing the importance and impact data privacy has on their business</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Misunderstanding the data privacy principles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-differentiating data privacy and security</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not being able to identify data categories correctly</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lacking efficient data governance strategy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing “bolt-on” patching solutions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missing the right team expertise</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Talking about individuals, what actions should average Internet users take to protect their personal data online?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before taking action, we advise users to be informed about the data privacy rights they have and then to act on them. </span></p>
<p><b>Share with us, what’s next for Pryv?  </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have recently introduced a powerful extension of our services by </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2022/04/01/in-cooperation-with-the-team-of-pryv-sa-open-web-technology-launches-its-data-privacy-excellence-practice-to-design-digital-solutions-ensuring-personal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">teaming up with OpenWT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As part of Pryv corporate development and pivotal time of growth, Pryv continues its full operations, focused on delivering licenses of its proprietary Pryv.io software, while data privacy consultancy services will be carried out by the OpenWT Data Privacy Excellence Practice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io Personal Data Mapping to enable automatic integration with existing warehouses.</span></p>

<h2><b>Integrate existing data warehouses with Pryv.io privacy back-end:</b></h2>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make legacy systems (warehouses) easy to integrate with new external systems within a privacy-compliant environment. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Significantly reduce time and errors managing data-subject requests.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv developed and commercialized a privacy-by-design middleware system that provides fu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ll, innovative personal data</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> life cycle management. This technology allows for privacy compliance, interoperability and data sharing to a granular-level, using transparent, unambiguous enforcement of consent applied on a data set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io Data Mapping provides companies with existing data warehouses the means to adopt faster innovation, integrate real-world personal data and build better personalised services, all within a transparent and privacy-compliant environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing systems usually face major hurdles integrating with external solutions with the synchronisation of very big datasets and the transfer and storage of multiple copies of sensitive data. Pryv.io Data Mapping allows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to benefit from the capacity of privacy-by-design models;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">map dynamically existing datasets in a transparent and unambiguous form, presented to an individual for his enlightened consent;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unlock the capacity to offer privacy on legacy datasets.  </span></li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Current status for managing data-subject requests on personal data access </b><b>and processing by systems without privacy-by-design architecture:</b></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, initiating a NEW data processing in organizations with legacy systems involves time consuming processing for the Data Protection Officer (DPO) to scope the necessary datasets, collect consents and verify compliance with applicable regulations. Furthermore, it requires manual intervention of technicians to extract datasets. Multi-employees interaction and manual processes are prolonged, lack efficiency and generate errors. Such processes would not be acceptable in the short-mid term. Investments in innovation and automation must be considered. (Pic. 1)</span></p>

<p><b>Solution: Personal Data Mapping to enable automatic integration with </b><b>existing warehouse for managing data-subject requests on personal data </b><b>access and processing</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet the needs of mapping large data warehouses, data lakes and highly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dynamic data sets, Pryv has developed a new technology that maps dynamically </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing datasets in a transparent and unambiguous form to be presented to an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">individual for his enlightened consent.  </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unlocking the capacity to offer privacy on legacy datasets allows us to provide our services to a much broader set of companies handling personal data, which is important since the older ones are more in need of an up-to-date system regarding privacy regulations.” says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO and co-founder of Pryv SA.</span></i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether intentionally or not, when data integrity has been compromised, it can not only result in serious risks for the data subjects concerned, but also make the company appear untrustworthy.  Data with compromised integrity can not only create risks for the data subject itself, but also position the entire company’s reputation and operations at risk.</span></i></p>
<p><b>Once lost, trust cannot be easily found, or not at all.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data tampering attacks are a serious threat. And as recent news indicates an upsurge of cyber-attacks against personal data-fueled businesses worldwide, one that should be taken seriously. Imagine the repercussions of a clinical trial results based on data altered by an attacker.</span></p>
<p><b>Data can be tampered with in many ways.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the worst cases, these alterations may even remain undetected. So how can you ensure that data has not been subject to unauthorized changes along the way?</span></p>
<p><b>Data Integrity</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data integrity refers to the accuracy and consistency (validity) of data over the </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/27/data-lifecyle-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data lifecycle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It means that the data, from the time it was collected to the time it was stored, used, shared, archived and deleted, can be trusted to be accurate and free from tampering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulations such as the </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/12/11/gdpr-checklist-pryv/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1993/1962_1962_1962/en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiss DPA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in particular provide for such a requirement as a key principle to ensure that data is adequately protected, which is of utmost importance when it comes to the collection and usage of personal data assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By ensuring data integrity, companies ensure that data is exactly as it should be at any given time, which is key for health data, medical information, or contractual documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (eg.: with a digital signature (</span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/06/04/econsent-management-for-remote-and-decentralized-clinical-trials/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eConsent)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Clinical Trials DCT), etc)</span></p>
<p><b>How is Data Integrity achieved by Pryv.io? &#8211; Generating a checksum for all data uploaded</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a document or information is created or modified on Pryv.io, a receipt is issued with a “</span><b>checksum</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, which can then be used to detect unexpected  modification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The receipt does not expose any personal data, but simply serves as proof of integrity. You can think of this receipt (checksum) as your data’s fingerprint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ability to check for data accuracy and consistency can be very valuable in the context of Remote Clinical Trials.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">For example: Tom, a participant of the trial, uploads a document on a dedicated online platform to be shared with Dr.Jones, his investigator:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the upload is completed, a receipt is issued to Tom with the following checksum: “1582054665”.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom can share the receipt (checksum) with Bob separately. And tell Bob that the document he will get must have the same checksum (“1582054665”). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, Bob could compute the checksum when he receives the document and send it to Dr.Jones, who can then confirm that the “fingerprints” match. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a single bit of the document is changed, the checksum will be fully different. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>What added value does it bring?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether on purpose or by accident, compromising data integrity can not only result in serious risks for the data subjects, but also put the entire company’s reputation and operations at risk. At any given time, individuals using a platform, or an app built on Pryv.io can verify that the data has not been subject to any unauthorized change.</span></p>
<p><b>Data Audit &amp; Integrity?</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/25/audit-logs-in-pryv-io-when-every-single-piece-of-information-matters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audit logs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> maintain a full and complete history of every change that has been made on a piece of data, by whom and when. An audit log is the simplest, yet also one of the most effective forms of tracking temporal information. Any time something significant happens, a record indicating what happened and when it happened, is generated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coupled with this audit feature and versioning of Pryv.io, companies can rebuild the data lifecycle to prove the genuinity of the data.</span></p>
<p><b>Blockchain &#8211; Full data integrity support for Pryv.io enables a new level of trust and confidence between our customers and their partners</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pryv.io data integrity mechanism is designed to be coupled with a timestamping solution or a blockchain. In that case, the blockchain would keep all the receipts for public (or private) consultation. </span></p>
<p><b>Data worths nothing if not trustworthy</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Pryv we continuously work on advancing Pryv.io functionalities to ensure we deliver an outstanding technology not only to meet technical and legal requirements, to ensure confidentiality and trustworthiness of data, but embed trust in any aspect of building a strong relationship with your customers. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>This partnership brings two leading Swiss startups committed to accelerating healthcare&#8217;s digital transformation while maintaining the highest standard on information security and data privacy.</strong></p>
<p><em>Lausanne / Zurich 7th October 2021 The Swiss-based pioneers in healthcare innovation, Sleepiz which provides a Medical Grade Respiration Monitor and Pryv, the health data, privacy and consent management solution provider announced today a strategic collaboration to foster hospital remote monitoring adoption at ease. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Covid-19 crisis put the spotlight on the digital roadmap of any hospital institution. The use of digital tools for improving outpatient care is growing faster than ever. At the rise of the expected 4th Covid-19 wave the healthcare systems are exponentially investing in adopting telehealth solutions and providing remote care as a secure and trusted alternative of traditional care. Reasons for telehealth investments by hospitals are multiple. Telehealth solutions allow hospitals to ease the burden on nurses and doctors while being able to cater to more patients and even focusing on the patients most in need through better triage. Although there are already a number of remote care technologies, adoption for hospitals remains challenging as most of them are not approved medical devices, lack privacy compliance and thus cannot be integrated in the heavily regulated processes the healthcare system has put in place.</p>
<p>To address this challenge and ensure a smooth workflow for physicians, caregivers and patients Sleepiz, the only medical grade (CE approved) contactless monitor and Pryv, a Swiss leader in privacy and patient data management solution provider, join efforts to bring a solution which not only meet the requirements of interoperability, easy and timely integration with the existing EHR, but delivers a ready-to-be-used platform for establishing trustful online communication with the patient. Sleepiz is the first healthcare company in Switzerland with ISO 277701 and ISO 27001 with certification of their system for data privacy and information security.</p>
<p>Pryv.io is a privacy-centric middleware, used as a robust data management foundation to develop risk-controlled mHealth, eHealth, and InsurTech applications with confidence and in respect to IT and regulatory requirements. The solution is used to manage large and diverse streams of data coming from external platforms, wearable devices, EHR/EMR and health record systems.</p>
<p>This partnership will help hospitals move towards digitizing their infrastructure and integrating homecare monitoring seamlessly into their ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>About Sleepiz:</strong></p>
<p>Sleepiz AG (Ltd.) is a Zürich based startup with a mission to provide patient-centric disease management through seamless integration of contactless monitoring into people’s homes. Sleepiz leverages the power of sleep insights with a device that is simply placed next to the bed. The device operates in a non-contact fashion and measures movements originating from heart contractions and breathing patterns, as well as body motions with medical grade accuracy.</p>
<p>While currently focusing on respiratory illnesses, Sleepiz aims to improve people’s lives by creating the future of healthcare. By making use of wireless millimeter wave technology, sensor fusion and artificial intelligence, in the future Sleepiz will not only be able to diagnose sleep disorders but also perform long-term monitoring. Thereby, the progression of chronic diseases will be monitored to allow faster intervention and better treatment.</p>
<p>Sleepiz is touching lives without touching.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">September 2021<br />
<a href="https://www.accord-healthcare.com/">Accord Healthcare (Accord)</a> announced the launch of <a href="https://www.unifyhealth.app/">Unify Health</a> – a new app for cancer patients and their carers undergoing treatment. This new resource has been devised by experts from across the cancer community to support and advise people on their physical and mental wellbeing whilst undergoing cancer treatment. The app can also connect patients with not just local pharmacists in their area but also community pharmacists who have trained to become ‘Community Cancer Champions.’ Experts at the Royal Marsden Hospital, a world-leading cancer centre and teaching institution have helped to develop a practical, bite-size training curriculum for the community pharmacists who wish to become Community Cancer Champions. The training provides advice on how to talk to and assist cancer patients, particularly around managing symptoms and worries. Undergoing cancer treatment can be bewildering, with an array of advice and support available from many different sources. This has only been made worse during the COVID-19 pandemic, as cancer patients may have felt the need to avoid healthcare facilities, for fear of being put at greater risk of coming into contact with the virus.</p>
<p>Unify Health aims to be an app that is always accessible, no matter whether it is night or day that provides cancer patients a toolkit of tailored advice and information with the ability to locate community pharmacists with training on the management of cancer symptoms. Confidentiality is central to development of trust between patient and healthcare professionals. Ensuring privacy can help promote more effective communication and promote public confidence in the platform.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The Pryv solution allowed us to underpin our application with a secure and compliant platform for data storage bringing the application to market more rapidly than had that element been developed bespoke. Regulatory compliance in terms of personal data was at the heart of what we were trying to achieve here. All personal data collected within the app is managed via the Pryv.io patient data governance software and no patient data leaves the relevant territories (i.e. UK patient data stays in the UK, EU patient data stays in the EU). Pryv comes with must-have consent and auditing tools to keep the platform compliant with existing and forthcoming regulations.Their team were always on hand to support us through the onboarding and implementation stages of the project.” said Alex Williams, Head of Digital at Swordfish Advertising.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>About <a href="https://www.unifyhealth.app/">Unify Health</a>: Unify Health has been devised by experts from the healthcare industry working with hospitals,<br />
community pharmacists, clinicians, nurses, patient groups and charities to make support and advice more readily available to cancer patients. It provides a toolkit of tailored advice and information, plus a map to connect them with nearby local community pharmacists. Unify Health is available on both the Android and Apple app stores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>September 23rd, Switzerland</p>
<p><em>The strong need for digital solutions to collect real-world data from patients motivated Magnes’ team to deliver on a novel solution for monitoring patients. Magnes’ solution will allow personalized medication and treatments based on real-world data in addition to enabling healthcare professionals to monitor patients remotely at ease. Embedding the privacy-by-design Pryv.io solution, Magnes combines user-friendly operation -literally, patients just wear the shoes- and accurate gait data collection anywhere with confidence. </em></p>
<p>Neuro-degenerative diseases are becoming a burden for the healthcare systems with the aging population worldwide. Today most available medications and treatments have limited success in stopping disease progression and enabling full recovery for neuro-degenerative diseases. Personalization of medication and its dosage is extremely important for therapies to work effectively.  Reliable, unbiased data collection from patients in their day-to-day environment is crucial in disease management.</p>
<p>Today clinicians rely on self-reports to gain insight into what a person is doing in daily life. The assumption that patients’ activity at the clinic is comparable to the at-home activity may not be realistic. The current high-end solutions in the market for analyzing gait are complex systems installed in clinics (camera-based systems, pressure sensitive walkways) that take a long time for patient preparation and for analyzing data. Even if they offer a good assessment of the patient, they are not practical for continuous monitoring of patients. Furthermore, being in a laboratory setting and under the observation of clinicians biases patients and the gait parameters can diverge from the typical ones. So far, no commercial system has been designed for monitoring the progress of patients, especially at home.</p>
<p><em>“The well-known “White Coat Syndrome” that makes your blood pressure higher in front of a doctor applies to a wide range of measurements. With Magnes’ solution, patients can not only enjoy the comfort of their home, but also provide accurate and genuine health data.” says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv SA</em></p>
<p>Most of the existing wearable devices collecting activity data or gait data from individuals work well on healthy individuals but they fail to detect clinically relevant gait parameters from patients of neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s patients, who have atypical gait.</p>
<p><em>“Pryv allowed us to build a platform within days, which is transparent and compatible with all data privacy regulations. Our platform gives patients full control over their data while complying with GDPR and medical data management regulations. It gives both our clinical partners and patients confidence to use our solution without any hesitation. With its various data integration possibilities, Pryv software will allow us to easily scale up our business in different fields and geographies.” Magnes CEO Dr. Olgac Ergeneman says. </em></p>
<p>Using sensors embedded in sneaker-like shoes and proprietary AI empowered algorithms allow Magnes to collect objective clinical-grade data during daily activities. Magnes has validated their solution with gold standard measurement systems and demonstrated the clinical usage at leading neurological clinics. Some of the algorithms run on the shoes to enable real-time processing for personalized therapy and can provide immediate haptic stimulation to the patient to improve patients’ mobility and quality of life. Magnes’ solution is first targeted at patients of neurological and movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, dementia, and incomplete spinal cord injury.</p>
<p>Unique in its offering, Magnes offers a continuous monitoring solution for patients to collect data during their daily life activities without requiring patient preparation and doctor’s visit. It has the potential to change patients’ life quality by improving their mobility with the AI-powered haptic feedback technology.</p>
<p><strong>About Magnes: </strong> Magnes AG is a technology spinoff from the Multi-Scale Robotics Lab of ETH Zurich. Magnes developed a continuous monitoring solution for patients of neurological disorders. Magnes solution enables collection of real-world data from patients. Magnes developed AI-powered algorithms to provide personalized gait analysis and it can provide immediate haptic feedback to patients for improving their mobility.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv has joined the RealWorld4Clinic project which creates a device connected by artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance patient care. Pryv eHealth backend ensures privacy-by-design development and compliant real-world patient data collection, usage and sharing. </span></i></p>
<p><b>From reactive to proactive heart health: Inspired by consumer wearable devices, RealWorld4Clinic, set about creating a wearable that could collect data suitable for drug approval trials and guide interventions in heart failure management.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heart failure is responsible for five per cent of emergency hospital stays and two per cent of national health expenditure within Europe. Furthermore, COVID-19 pandemic has represented a clinical challenge in patients with heart failure. It’s widely accepted that real-world data is vital for diagnosing heart failure early. Yet, clinical research and heart failure management still buy in data, limiting the predictive power of clinical trials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By diagnosing heart failure aggravation from 30 days before an emergency event occurs, RealWorld4Clinic will halve the number of days patients spend in a hospital, while reducing hospital costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RealWorld4Clinic will achieve its ambitions through the market launch of SentinHealth‘s MyHeartSentinel – a coin-sized medical device anchored to the fundus of the stomach in immediate proximity to the heart and the lungs or, optionally, implanted subcutaneously in the chest area.  Equipped with multiple sensors MyHeartSentinel shall acquire a wide array of real-world cardio-respiratory health data. Via SentinHealth’s gateway and regulated through Pryv eHealth data privacy-preserving patient’s data management backend will be deployed on a cloud infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to co-creating the wearable MyHeartSentinel product, EIT Health will help resolve the ethical, legal and social issues involved with buying and using AI to maximise heart health data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In clinical research, AI-powered analytics shall reveal information on the real-world safety and tolerability of an investigational medicinal product or device. This is forecasted to add value to the decision making of pharma on the continuation of its clinical development. In outpatient cardiology, AI-powered analytics shall reveal real-world information on the pre-symptomatic progression of heart failure. This is forecasted to prevent heart failure decompensation while reducing the number of outpatient visits and days spent in the hospital.</span></p>

<p><b>About RealWorld4Clinic: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">RealWorld4Clinic is a new pan-European project aiming at bringing real-world data to pivotal clinical research and outpatient cardiology care. The EU-funded project is part of the innovation portfolio curated by the EIT Health knowledge and innovation community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MyHeartSentinel is just the beginning. Supported by EIT Health, the RealWorld4Clinic consortium is committed to transforming the standard of care from reactive to proactive heart health management. By diagnosing heart failure aggravation from 30 days before an emergency event occurs, RealWorld4Clinic will halve the number of days patients spend in a hospital, while reducing hospital costs.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>HES-So introduces EREBOTS: an agent-based framework forchatbot based on Pryv.io eHealth backend</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EREBOTS enable the configuration and deployment of personalized chatbots to support users in multi-topic and multi-campaign behavioral change programs with full respect to data privacy. Conversational agents coaching people fighting chronic diseases, addictions, and other health issues, leading to decreased life quality are among EREBOTS applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare and eHealth systems are facing the strain of a significant demand for user (patient) empowerment—implying the need for new logics, architectures, dynamics, and interfaces</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siri, Alexa and Cortana are among the best known intelligent systems that  have the ability to assist humans through multimodal interactions, including text, buttons, vocal, video, and gesture-based communication. Although such virtual assistants heavily rely on vocal interactions, sometimes more discrete and asynchronous chat-like communications are still preferred. Chatbots are an example of intelligent systems relying on interactions mostly menu/text-based. Anywhere/anytime availability, immediate response, confidentiality, social acceptance, and massive scalability are among the factors contributing to the increasing and an effective adoption of chatbots in a wide range of domains, particularly for motivational such as for social network campaigns and support, customer management, eHealth and assisted-living scenarios. In the healthcare domain, chatbots leveraging on tailored support and social aspects can be of great support to foster behavioural change, monitoring of chronic health conditions and primary care to name a few. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, most of the modern chatbots rely on state machines (implementing conversational rules) and one-fits-all approaches, </span><b>neglecting personalization, data-stream privacy management,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> multi-topic management/interconnection, and multimodal interactions. This leads to significant limitations in inadequate personalization, lack of real-time monitoring, reporting and customization for medical personnel, lack of mechanisms to integrate communities of chatbots, limited knowledge sharing capabilities, and the impossibility of seamlessly deploying multi-domain campaigns within the same framework.  These limitations are linked to the predominantly rigid architectures proposed in most existing approaches. Most chatbot solutions rely on monolithic and centralized data management strategies, making it hard to comply with privacy regulations such as GDPR, Swiss DPA. The sensitive nature of data collected through chatbot interactions makes it necessary to shift the control of personal data towards the users themselves, empowering them in the process. </span><b> EREBOTS uses an instance of Pryv to persist the user’s chat history and all personal data. Employing Pryv, users gain exclusive control of their data, thus being able to revoke the consent at any point, disabling EREBOT access to it, and, if necessary, fully removing any stored piece of information.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet EREBOTS:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-scenario agent-based chatbot framework: In EREBOTS, it is possible to combine several context-dependent behaviors that can be encapsulated in dedicated story lines, which can be modeled as isolated or interconnected scenarios. These behaviors are enacted by a network of user agents, doctor agents, and orchestrated through gateway agents.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User personalization: User agents build a model of the user profile, his/her preferences, history, goals, and aggregated information. With this model, the user agents are able to tailor behaviors and provide a personalized experience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare personnel control and monitoring: Medical doctors and healthcare providers have the possibility of defining possible goals, configure self-assessment interactions, or customize the types of activities proposed to patients/participants. Moreover, they can monitor users’ profiles with detailed analytics describing their behaviors and aggregated trends.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy and ethics compliance: In EREBOTS, all the sensitive/personal information are solely under the control of the user, who can make any decisions concerning storage and sharing of her information. Through the Pryv.io platform integrated into EREBOTS, users may configure fine-grained access control or even entirely remove their data if they decide so.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>COTIDIANA is a mobile solution that allows the remote monitoring of PROMs and sensor data from people with rheumatic diseases </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rheumatic conditions are a problem that affects a great percentage of the world’s population, with a particular incidence in the elderly, since these diseases tend to increase with age. The time gap between medical appointments makes it difficult to monitor patients’ symptoms and experiences. COTIDIANA supports data collection at home, in a more holistic and efficient approach, through self-report by the patient (signs, symptoms, quality of life), and also by passive sensing which enable the analysis of information such as manual dexterity, gait, physical activity level and sociability patterns (indicative of well-being and mental health).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COTIDIANA solution will include a smartphone app for patients and a web portal, that will be accessed by health professionals and that will display data since the previous visit to the clinician. Data collection will contribute to people&#8217;s medical care and drug trials. For the platform development, 130 people will be included in 3 clinical trials, which are planned for 2022 in Austria and in Portugal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io eHealth backend is used for the patient consent, the data collection, structure, sharing and storage, the integration with eCRF form and other clinical and hospital systems, as well as the foundation on which the COTIDIANA mobile and web-interfaces will be developed. The privacy-by-design and distributed data storage, alongside with the consent management and auditing capabilities of the Pryv.io eHealth backend will allow to achieve full compliance with GDPR, Swiss DPA, the specific ethical, clinical data and data protection regulations within the partnering and clinical institutions in Portugal, Austria and across Europe and will greatly facilitate complying with MDD and SaMD certification process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting in April 2021, the COTIDIANA is a 28-month project, financed by the AAL programme which involves 6 international partners: Fraunhofer Portugal AICOS, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Definition12 AG, Mag. Andreas Raffeiner GmbH, Medizinische Universität Wien, and Pryv SA. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pryv.io eHealth backend is available in open-source and under licensing agreement. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Building Privacy-Preserving Smart Cities: Myth or Reality?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From traffic congestion reduction to utility consumption improvement, care services optimization, new environmental and circular economy perspective, smart cities promise to enhance our lives in almost any aspects. Who hasn&#8217;t dreamt of such a utopia?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For every improvement in the city, though, there are significant risks for privacy that if neglected could lead to very damaging results for us all, if not the ultimate rise of surveillance capitalism, turning utopian intentions into dystopian catastrophe. In this context, solving the underlying privacy issue has become a must-have priority for anyone involved in smart city developments.</span></p>
<p><b>Myth: Thinking that digital innovation can only be achieved at the expense of privacy. </b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should we really make a choice between boosting smart-city initiatives vs privacy?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has been the question in numerous discussions around smart cities concepts and projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is indisputable that access to vast amounts of personal data is needed to make our cities smarter and enable digital enhancements. Yet in light of recent events that casted a harsh light on the notion of personal data collection and privacy respect, it would seem that the only way to ensure no harmful, unauthorized use of the data is to not share data at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what trade-off should we make?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">should we enable city improvements at the cost of privacy? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or should we protect privacy at the cost of general welfare and accountability? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The common mistake here consists of thinking that digital innovation can only be achieved at the expense of privacy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is this unwavering myth that privacy is the price to pay for better, personalized services, security or mobility in the city. Protecting data and privacy rights, however, should not be up for a trade-off in any future smart city.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what if there was a better option? </span><a style="color: #800000;" href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/06/08/pryv-sa-releases-an-open-source-solution-for-personal-data-privacy-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The release of Open Pryv.io shows that there is a way to encourage personal data collection being done right.</span></a></span></h3>
<h3></h3>
<p><b>Reality: </b><b><i>“Privacy doesn’t have to be only secrecy. We envision a world where privacy is the ability to share your data with awareness and control.” &#8211; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evelinageorgieva/">Evelina Georgieva</a> @ <a href="https://www.pryv.com/about-pryv/">Pryv SA</a></i></b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, locking all access to the data is not a sustainable solution if we are aiming for a brighter, technology-enhanced future. Benefiting from data-fueled solutions would not only help improve the city at many levels, but also provide us with new opportunities for self-development, bringing awareness to our patterns and unsustainable behaviors.</span></p>
<p><b>Finding &#8220;luxury in self-reproach&#8221;.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At some degree, smart cities could promote accountability and we might even find that there is some &#8220;luxury in self-reproach&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine a world where users would be able to step up and face the reality of their behaviours and impact on the planet, and where providers would offer the users real control over their data, including the ability to verify that it is used rightly, as well as real choice and transparency as to who and what services can access their data at a granular level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s up to us to make this world the reflection of our reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So where to start to make it happen?</span></p>
<p><b>The real deal: Consensual Privacy-Preserving Data Collection and Management</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relying on privacy-preserving technologies might just be the perfect option to start your project on solid rock foundations. There have already been a number of existing solutions that will greatly help you not only save time and resources, but develop smart cities applications rightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do have something for you as well: a ready-to-use, privacy-focused back-end solution to enable embedding such technologies to your project while addressing all </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/27/data-lifecyle-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal data lifecycle management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aspects, including consent management, interoperability and scalability. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This partnership is for us, </span></i><a href="https://www.agaetis.fr/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agaetis,</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a great opportunity to co-work on great projects with </span></i><a href="http://pryv.com"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv,</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and its high level of expertise team. We feel that we are complementary partners to address companies&#8217; needs regarding data privacy and its management, from the solution edition to its deployment, its setup. Our competencies allow us to even design and create bespoke applications for a full package.”  says Nicolas Roux, CEO at Agaetis.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 and Covid-19 undoubtedly accelerated digitization in any aspect of our lives, making a strong push over the technology tipping point at unimaginable speed. Companies have rapidly started developing digital platforms that process customers’ personal data pumping great amounts of user data into their system: from digital health and remote monitoring of patients, education, infrastructure optimizations and consumer behaviour analysis in almost any industry one could think of. For each of these new digital offerings, there are a number of privacy pitfalls that if neglected will easily lead to very damaging results and loss of business. Meeting the highest privacy regulations became must-have priority for development teams.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solid, flexible, ready to use, here are some adjectives that perfectly describe why we trust the </span></i><a href="http://pryv.io"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solution. Perfect if you want to deploy a data framework managing data privacy, we figured out that it’s still manageable to even adapt it to an existing data management solution, as we experience it with one of our projects. The easy-to-use and heavily documented open-source tool, as well as the good communication with the Pryv team, confirm our choice! We are convinced that we will use this privacy solution in our projects, of course in the healthcare field but we are confident that it could be deployed on others.&#8221;</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says Nicolas Roux, CEO at Agaetis.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, to achieve winning digital transformation, technology is not enough on its own: understanding the relation between humans and technology is crucial to develop sustainable digital transformation. Often misunderstood, human-centric digitalization is not just about engaging UI and UX. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">To deliver a truly human-centric digital experience, it is essential to focus on key concepts about exactly understanding user needs, so that benefits exceed the cost of sharing personal data. This is the first and most critical step on building trusted, long term relationships.” says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv “We are very excited to collaborate with Agaetis: Passionate about innovative technology and cultivating collective intelligence, Agaetis integrates this cocktail into its productions. Data science and AI are in Agaetis DNA. Blended with our expertise in data privacy and Pryv.io technology stack for data acquisition, management and storage, we can offer a complete 360 digital transformation solution. “ </span></i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">SwissDPA, GDPR, ePrivacy and more&#8230;</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As experts of data privacy, at Pryv, we continuously invest our best efforts to deeply investigate how data protection regulations might affect your company and what you should keep in mind when dealing with sensitive personal data.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the GDPR has already started to collect its fees from non-compliant companies, the European Union keeps tightening up its digital market standards, and third countries like Switzerland might be left with no choice but to adapt if they want to keep exchanging data with Europe. So where do you stand in the middle of all these regulations?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will try to provide you with a comprehensive overview of the current Swiss-EU privacy landscape, and help you prepare for what’s coming next.</span></i></p>
<p><b>GDPR</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a Swiss company and you’re dealing with sensitive personal data, chances are that GDPR-compliance has been your concern for some months now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effective since 25 May 2018, the GDPR raised the bar at a whole new level for data protection and privacy regulations, leaving tons of companies collecting and/or processing EU citizens personal data with the only choice of either complying, or paying fines up to €20M or 4% of annual income. And this was just the beginning.</span></p>
<p><b>At its core, GDPR is a response to a need for action.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But the GDPR was not only designed to ensure an adequate level of data protection for EU citizens. It was also designed to set up a new standard, and help implement the current European strategy for a EU Single Digital Market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how exactly might this affect your company? Well:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy rights of European citizens are not limited by European borders (ref: </span><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-3-gdpr/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://gdpr-info.eu/art-3-gdpr/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">): so whether your company is based in Europe or not, if you want to expand your offer of services to EU citizens (or even monitor their behaviour within the EU), you will have to comply with the GDPR first.</span></li>
<li>Personal data transfers outside the EU are subject to numerous provisions under the GDPR (ref: https://gdpr-info.eu/art-44-gdpr/): so at some point, if you want to exchange data with Europe, you may have to demonstrate that your company provides an adequate level of data protection for this data.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Swiss Data Protection Act (&#8220;Swiss DPA&#8221;) has been revised and will force Swiss companies to better align with the European standard: so even if you’re a Swiss-only business, you will still have to comply with a number of GDPR-like requirements.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, </span><b>if you’re in the healthcare business</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the GDPR provides an extra level of protection regarding the processing of specific personal data like genetic data, biometric data and any data concerning health (Ref: </span><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), adding yet another level of requirements to meet with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you take all that under consideration?</span></p>
<p><b>Swiss DPA</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GDPR does not only affect Swiss companies, but also Switzerland itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a new Swiss DPA (&#8220;revDPA&#8221;) has been adopted by the Swiss parliament in September 2020, a number of GDPR-like requirements will soon make their appearance in the Swiss legislation as the GDPR was largely taken under consideration during the revision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the revDPA introduces a right to portability, a duty to inform of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> personal data collection, and an obligation to keep an inventory of processing activities, similarly to what is currently provided by the GDPR.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what does this mean for you? Well, even if you’re not dealing with Europe and are not planning to, if your company falls under Swiss DPA, you will have to comply with all of its new GDPR-like requirements when the revDPA comes into force.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To know more about the key amendments and its impacts on Switzerland, we encourage you to read </span><a href="https://www.parlament.ch/centers/eparl/curia/2017/20170059/Texte%20pour%20le%20vote%20final%203%20NS%20F.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the text</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the revDPA project and the sources provided at the end of this article, especially </span><a href="https://francoischarlet.ch/2020/nouvelle-lpd-ce-qui-va-changer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by François Charlet, which highlights the changes and measures to be taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing that you might want to keep in mind is that all of these new obligations will largely apply as soon as the new law comes into force. And as outlined in an article written by Walder Wyss Associates, sharing recommendations for revDPA implementation, &#8220;</span><a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=76e7877a-a433-45bc-a6b0-30cb095b51b5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the implementation of the revDPA requires early planning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, even if the revDPA is expected to come into force in 2022, we strongly advise Swiss companies to not wait until then to start preparing for it.</span></p>
<p><b>ePrivacy</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As said before, the GDPR was just the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the pursuit of its strategy for a single digital market and to reinforce the level of privacy protection of its citizens, the EU is now under discussion to endorse a new regulation intended to replace the current ePrivacy Directive and specify/complement the GDPR: the ePrivacy Regulation (ePR).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep it simple, the ePR is having similar focus as the GDPR but specifically targets electronic communications. From that perspective, it is most likely that Swiss companies will be impacted, too. </span><a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/news/eu-presidency-releases-revised-draft-eprivacy-0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A revised draft for the ePR has just been released in November 2020.</span></a></p>

<p><b>So what should you know? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, since the ePR is intended to specify/complement the GDPR:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the GDPR applies to you, so could ePR if your offer of services extend to electronic communications.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of conflict between the two regulations, ePR will take precedence over the GDPR (which means it will be applied first).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, ePR fines for non-compliance are expected to be as high as in the GDPR: so in case of infringement, you could have to pay a fine of up to €20M or 4% of your company’s annual income (whichever is higher). Wouldn’t it be better to invest into a compliance strategy instead?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the ePR is intended to particularise and complement the GDPR, it is also foreseen that it “will have a disruptive effect on companies’ digital strategies, which will need to be redefined to meet the new requirements.” However, it doesn’t necessarily have to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we like saying at Pryv, in cases like this, you just have to establish a solid and scalable foundation prior to building the house. Thus, you’ll be sure that eventually, your system components will be scalable to comply with any new forthcoming requirements.</span></p>
<p><b>And if you’re in the healthcare business…</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ePR is not the only new EU regulation that is to be expected within the next few years. As Europe keeps raising the standards of its regulations, a new regulation for medical devices is also making its way towards the EU market: the Medical Device Regulation (MDR).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially, </span><b>if you’re developing a mhealth app</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: MDR could become a major concern for you as your software could now be registered as a “medical device” under this new legislation, adding yet another level of requirements to comply with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it may feel like a downfall of complex challenges for your company, it doesn’t have to be.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/02/25/get-your-mdr-compliance-done-right-explained-in-3-minutes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get your MDR compliance done right: explained in a less than 5 minutes read</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2015, we have been discussing with hundreds of healthcare innovators and listening to their needs, so that we could help businesses like yours build solutions that respect not only data privacy and protection regulations, but also existing and forthcoming regulations for managing personal health data.</span></p>
<p><b>The end… or the and?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By design, when we decided to bring Pryv.io on the market as a ready-to-be-used solution for personal and health data, we invested in making sure that we can ensure your products can easily benefit from integrated compliance over different industries and market-specific regulations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yours,</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">EU-US Privacy Shield Privacy Shield &amp; Swiss-US Privacy Shield updates as per November 2020</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, transatlantic personal data transfers have become common practice. Under the </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/11/25/gdpr-swiss-dpa-e-privacy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> though, these transfers are subject to numerous provisions, in particular to ensure that the data will benefit from adequate protection, even when being transferred abroad. In this context, the EU-US Privacy Shield </span><a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Framework</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was designed to provide companies “with a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the EU to the US”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a landmark </span><a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=228677&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=14854672"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that shined a light on data protection issues relating to these transfers, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) </span><a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2020-07/cp200091en.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invalidated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the EU-US Privacy Shield, leaving tons of companies with more questions than answers about how to address this issue. Indeed, following this decision, any and all data transfers once valid under the EU-US Privacy Shield ought to be revised in order to remain GDPR compliant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some well-recognized organizations took actions to identify alternative solutions, like</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cytowski &amp; Partners who </span><a href="https://cytlaw.medium.com/privacy-shield-got-canceled-what-now-790cba542c84"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suggest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the following alternatives for companies impacted by the decision:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to relocate data processing operations inside the EU and cease EU-US data transfers;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to rely on Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”), as it remains a valid compliance mechanism for the transfer of personal data outside of Europe;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to obtain individuals’ explicit consent to the transfer;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to implement Binding Corporate Rules (GDPR Art. 47); or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to rely, when appropriate, on specific derogations (GDPR Art. 49).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Updates for Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the SCCs were not invalidated by the CJEU, the ruling introduced further requirements to be met in this regard. In addition, “</span><a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=6ec88853-1da9-4327-923c-2f909c7a89fe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a case-by-case assessment as to whether [the SCCs] have provided appropriate safeguards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” is now mandatory for any affected companies. If proven to be insufficient, the SCCs shall and may be supplemented with additional measures to ensure an adequate level of data protection. In early November 2020, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) adopted </span><a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2020/european-data-protection-board-41st-plenary-session-edpb-adopts-recommendations_en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recommendations on supplementary measures following Schrems II</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield highlights the importance of relying on the right solutions, in particular to prevent companies from being disrupted by such decisions. For a company having to address such issues post-disruption, it can be very hard as it requires to have the resources and knowledge to do so. However, ready-to-use data management solutions that allow for privacy compliance and flexibility over time exist and could help in this matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our on-premise software Pryv.io, for example, allows for </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/08/03/data-residency-insights-on-where-to-store-the-personal-data-you-collect/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">distributed data storage to enable local regulations compliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and also to create installations that span the globe and co-locate the data with the users’ legislation. Based on a powerful per-user and privacy-by-design approach, each user data can be stored in a different server, which can be relocated anywhere if needed. Pryv.io also provides a clear data sharing mechanism and </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/guides/consent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consent management solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, thus enabling companies to easily update their customers’ consent at a granular level.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/25/audit-logs-in-pryv-io-when-every-single-piece-of-information-matters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">De-risk your compliance with data-audit at Pryv.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Updates for Swiss-US Privacy Shield as of September 2020.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following “Schrems II” ruling, the Swiss Data Protection and Information Commissioner </span><a href="https://www.rts.ch/info/suisse/11588815-les-donnees-des-suisses-ne-sont-pas-assez-protegees-aux-etatsunis.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the Swiss-US Privacy Shield does not provide an adequate level of protection for Swiss-US data transfers and the mention &#8220;adequate level under certain conditions&#8221; was removed for the United States. Although the Swiss-US Privacy Shield was not invalidated at that time, Swiss companies are </span><a href="https://francoischarlet.ch/2020/cjue-privacy-shield-invalide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to rapidly start addressing this concern.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>TeleMedicine in Pandemia </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been many expectations towards telemedicine during the last few months. While sanitary measures were rapidly put in place to decrease the spread of the disease, a suitable solution had yet to be found to ensure that sick patients would not be denied access to primary care in the pursuit of containing the epidemic. Telemedicine was expected to address this concern and make it possible for everyone to get medical help in this time of crisis. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this really what happened though?</span></i></p>
<p><b>TeleMedicine in Pandemia: expectations vs. reality</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the edge of the second wave of the disease, the question as to whether our reality caught up with our expectations is now more relevant than ever. That is, can we say today that telemedicine has made its way to address burning needs arising from current and forthcoming lockdowns and contact minimization policies? While the adoption of tele-solutions has grown significantly in many areas, the same seems still hard to say for the healthcare sector. In Switzerland, particularly, telemedicine appears to be more of a hard pill to swallow than a widely accepted solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reluctance to adopt telehealth innovations at a time of increasing need for medical care and help raises concerns at many levels. In April 2020, cardiologists were already warning about a decrease in consultations for heart disease. In their opinion, it wasn’t that there were less sick patients in this regard, but rather that these patients stayed home due to a confusion with covid symptoms or by fear of going to a hospital. At the same time, care facilities were often advising people with possible covid-related symptoms to stay put in quarantine. For people experiencing a mental health worry, accessing medical support in-person became equally far less straightforward. “So where can people find the trusted help they need?”</span></p>
<p><b>TeleMedicine in Pandemia: why the low-rate adoption?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If arguments referring to the complexities of remote consultations were valid at a normal time, they seem hardly convincing when they imply to deny access to primary care during a pandemic crisis. More than ever, we need to push through our fear of change and find solutions that not only “restrict” but are also supportive of the people who need it the most. For example, countries like Germany found a way to recognize “</span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/03/23/conquering-the-german-market-diga-fast-track-kit-for-digital-health-innovators/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apps on prescription</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and to procure doctors and insurers with an up-to-date legislative framework to foster the adoption of digital health solutions. Is this what we lack in Switzerland to make telemedicine a reality?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, given the current situation, to not embrace technology enabled solutions might no longer be an option. Especially considering that adopting telemedicine could help the system absorb the increasing demand for medical help so that more patients can have access to proper treatments, whether in physical, 1-1 consultation or from the comfort of their home. For patients with chronic disease, it could even be life changing. A recent example is the </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/10/21/heartkinetics-the-daily-home-cardiac-monitoring-solution-chose-pryv-io-privacy-middleware-to-manage-patients-data-and-consent-rightfully/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HeartKinetics cardiac monitoring solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allows patients to easily monitor the cardiac function from home in less than 2 minutes, saving time travelling to the hospital and receiving more frequent analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, despite all the benefits that such a solution might represent, the low-rate adoption still appears to persist and telemedicine itself  seems to be still perceived as limited in a number of aspects. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Collecting information with existing tools and helping patients when they are not physically present is common practice. During the pandemic patients would not come to the office for good or bad reasons, and more often mail photos and call for advice. This actually did grow TeleMedecine while requiring as usual accurate documentation in the existing electronic system. Why then move fast forward to engage with new applications which claim to enable better TeleMedecine? The digital transformation is an engine of economic growth. But at the scale of a general medicine practice for it to be of benefit, there must be incentives that engage the &#8220;hearts and minds&#8221; of physicians. Two hurdles remain: first, real integration of the single problem solutions, who actually match only part of the many specific needs. Second, to go beyond the digital transformation will always require a humane personal relationship even without the patient being present.&#8221;  Pietro Scalfaro, Pediatrician.</span></i></p></blockquote>
<p><b>TeleMedicine in Pandemia: the privacy dilemma</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another concern that seems to contribute to the reluctance of adopting telemedicine to face the epidemic is the privacy dilemma. While technologies are certainly recognized as a valid solution in the fight against the virus, many say that privacy is a main concern. Still, solutions exist. Since the pandemia, a lot of efforts have been invested into finding privacy-preserving solutions. For example, we at </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/06/22/personal-data-consent-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv made our solution available in OpenSource</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that anyone can benefit from a free, privacy-by-design, swiss-made software solution on top of which they can rapidly create and build their own digital applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In parallel, telemedicine providers like </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2019/09/29/swiss-made-ehealth-tool-umana-selects-pryv-io-to-ensure-the-privacy-of-patient-doctor-communication/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Umana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.dthx.ch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DTHX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2018/08/26/meet-rivadigital-obpm-blood-pressure-monitoring-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riva Digital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/10/21/heartkinetics-the-daily-home-cardiac-monitoring-solution-chose-pryv-io-privacy-middleware-to-manage-patients-data-and-consent-rightfully/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HeartKinetics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provide doctors, patients and care facilities with ready-to-use, proven telehealth solutions, having privacy at their core. Together with our partners <a href="https://dreamix.eu/">Dreamix</a>, Pryv is also working on a new set of module components which will allow any provider willing to launch telemedicine and digital health solutions to be ready to go to market within a few days/weeks only from the start of the project, choosing the components that they need the most while embedding a strong solution for patient consent and privacy-by-design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe now is the time to turn our expectations into a reality?</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Embedding privacy into software apps.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the adoption of the GDPR, we all expect developers to embed privacy into existing and forthcoming software applications. But ask a thousand people to define what privacy is and you’ll get a thousand different answers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some, privacy is nothing more than secrecy. For others, it is everything related to their lives. Yet somehow, we expect developers to know what</span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2019/12/08/10-facts-developers-should-know-when-developing-personal-data-collecting-apps/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the &#8220;right&#8221; answer is for everyone. Arguing that all they have to do is to &#8220;respect users’ privacy&#8221; when developing personal data collecting apps.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But how exactly? This is the part that we never talk about: how privacy should effectively be embedded into existing and forthcoming designs.</span></p>
<p><b>Hacking the privacy principles: turning legal requirements into 1s and 0s</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it is easy to say that developers should respect users’ privacy, hardcoding these principles into software systems is certainly not. Still, that is precisely what is expected from them, as the </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2019/11/20/gdpr-swiss-dpa-e-privacy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR provides numerous privacy principles for developers to implement.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What it does not provide though, is a clear guidance on how these principles should be implemented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, we observe that GDPR concepts like &#8220;data minimisation&#8221; are still a blur for lots of people. Indeed, according to the regulation, &#8220;Personal data shall be: adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’)&#8221;. But what is adequate and relevant to someone might be interpreted in many different ways. So how can developers know that they have it right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly, they don’t. In their study </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1805/1805.09485.pdf"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why developers cannot embed privacy into software systems &#8211; an empirical investigation</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, researchers Senarath and Arachchilage specifically recognize this fact as one of the main problems developers face when attempting to embed privacy into their designs: they simply don’t know how to verify that they’ve done it right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now if they would go deeper into the GDPR, developers would know that: &#8220;appropriate technical and organisational measures, such as pseudonymisation […] are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimisation&#8221; (art. 25 § 1 GDPR). The thing is: do you know many developers who actually have read the 88 pages of the GDPR? Certainly not. And even if they did, would they be able to keep track of all the data protection principles that it refers to and understand how to interpret them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t expect lawyers to be able to implement technical solutions. So why expecting developers to be able to understand and navigate the law?</span></p>
<p><b>Minding the gap between tech and privacy experts: a collaborative approach</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, this situation requires a collaboration between all these different subject-matter experts &#8211; lawyers and developers &#8211; so that they can build digital solutions that are both legally rightful and technically feasible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Pryv, we understand the burning need for such solutions, which is why we provide any developers with </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/27/data-lifecyle-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a ready-to-use software foundation on which they can build their own personal data collecting apps.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Call it GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA or any other existing of forthcoming regulation that regulates privacy and individuals’ rights, our software was built to help developers address the complexity of such privacy-by-design legal requirements and meet business constraints such as short-term deadlines and restricted resources.</span></p>
<p><b>Expectations can equal Reality</b></p>
<p>Today, we have set-up high expectations to have everything available on a click away. While it is easy to blame why privacy is not respected, it is yet difficult to challenge the reality of the situation&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So really? Are developers lawyers to be? Might be not, as solutions are there to help: </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><b>Digital Ethics DNA: still unknown.</b></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology made it possible to have the world at a fingerprint. As a result, every day, millions of users leave their marks in the digital world, making it possible for companies to frame them into predictive, insightful “little boxes”. The question of whether it is for good or not will depend on how they will use this information. Is our personal information treated and used with ethics? Beyond what the law says, personal data and privacy regulations such as the GDPR or CCPA, we all have an inner sense of what is right and what is wrong. Digital Ethics is something that we all wish to believe in, but few know about it.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Loud Silence of Digital Ethics  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in personal data mobile apps</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Futurists foresee a world where everything would be technology-enabled. Some even picture it as the perfect utopia. A world where criminals would be caught before they even act. Where patients would be cured before they get sick. And where everyone would find love. A world governed by justice, health and ideal match. A perfect world… or maybe not?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While striving for this world, the line between right and wrong became blurred. And all of a sudden, what was supposed to turn into a dream ended up reflecting an alternative </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273388/aclu-clearview-ai-lawsuit-facial-recognition-database-illinois-biometric-laws"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nightmare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a world that could be governed by “secret” mass </span><a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/new-german-law-would-force-isps-to-allow-secret-service-to-install-trojans-on-user-devices/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surveillance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, biased algorithms, and companies leveraging personal and health data to increase their profits; convincing themselves that they are, ultimately, doing it for the “greater good”. Does the end justify the means though?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much has been said about technology enhancement, the power of personal data in enabling personalized services, offering, care and treatment. Unevenly, opening-up the Digital Ethics Pandora box is a taboo. Without any further delay, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">now </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">may be the time.</span></p>
<h3><b>The road to hell is paved with good intentions.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It always starts with a good idea. “Make the world a better place”. “Save the world”. Yet most of the time, without a strong ethic to frame it, even ideas that started with a </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/03/dont-be-evil-review-rana-foroohar-tech-giants-too-big-to-fail"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“don’t be evil”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mantra are doomed to perdition. Almost everyone has lost faith in the very notion of privacy. </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/23/consent/"><b>Trust needs restoring.</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As being “data plumbers” at Pryv, we see it a lot happening with personal data collected via mobile applications. Inspired to make a big change, however, innovators often lose themselves in what is right and what is not. </span><b>It is not that the technology or the idea behind it is necessarily bad in itself.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But like everything, if you don’t know your limits, you will eventually end up </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/12/google-medical-data-project-nightingale-secret-transfer-us-health-information"><span style="font-weight: 400;">beyond them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite often being hidden behind numbers, personal data can reveal a lot about individuals. What people eat, where they go, </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/26/tinder-personal-data-dating-app-messages-hacked-sold"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who they love</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In a perfect world, these data would be used to suggest the perfect restaurant, optimize transportation, pay for what you use, not more and save us from a life of loneliness. In today’s world though, this same data can equally be used to escalate insurance pricing, enact citizens’ surveillance, and manipulate thoughts and behaviours on command. And without the enforcement of a strong ethics to surround personal data collection, this might just become our permanent future.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Yin &amp; Yang in Digital Ethics.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can envision two mirroring worlds where the border line is Digital Ethics. On one side, being mindful of what is right can open up a world where we will all be doing well, healthier people and happier insurers, empowered citizens and </span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/10/17/75285/ai-fairer-than-judge-criminal-risk-assessment-algorithm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fairer judges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Or, on the mirroring side where the code of digital ethics is not respected, we can end up in a world where we are all prisoners of our own digital twin. A world governed by fear, predictability and </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/02/age-of-surveillance-capitalism-shoshana-zuboff-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surveillance capitalism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So which one is it going to be? At Pryv, we envision a world where </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/06/08/pryv-sa-releases-an-open-source-solution-for-personal-data-privacy-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy is the norm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And while it is true that we cannot control the future, we are still empowered to make decisions today that can allow for better privacy tomorrow. In fact, it is that simple: it is a matter of choice to do it; nothing more, nothing less. Let’s build a world where treating users with respect will pay back: so be transparent, consent-centric, </span><a href="https://pryv.com/2020/01/23/consent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restore trust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and build meaningful relationships with your users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2012, at Pryv, we deliver businesses a solution to empower them building trustful long-lasting relationships with their users, manage personal and sensitive data rightfully, being confident in processing, but not « shy » for asking for more. More data brings more insights and we are all willing to share more when we trust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is always the hardest, but we got your hand:</span></p>
<h3><b>Privacy-first Digital Ethics Handbook.</b></h3>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respect the moral principles: apply the “do no harm” principle to personal data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish norms dedicated to ensure that the autonomy and dignity of users is respected: Provide your development team with the</span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2019/12/08/10-facts-developers-should-know-when-developing-personal-data-collecting-apps/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to implement it “rightly”.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow your users to shape the debate and make informed choices.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Personal Data Economy is Raising! We are offered a lot, but we have lost the essentials. Be that service provider that is there to last. Respect Digital Ethics, Develop privacy-first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yours,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephanie &amp; Evelina</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Personal data aggregation, sharing and processing should be as effective, secure and trustworthy as online banking.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>UniRares (www.UniRares.ch) presents Patient support personal record: Empowering patients to take active role in their medical care</strong></p>
<p>In its first year of operation, the association UniRares has developed a paper version of the PSPR in order to help patients take an active role in their medical care, as they are often the best-placed to know their own disease, for better or worse.</p>
<p>This summary document aims at gathering and structuring all the different medical information that has been built over time, and should be presented to physicians during consultations. It can also serve as a reminder for the patient on the questions that he would want to ask during a medical consultation, and helps the isolated patient to gather on one single document the medical history, the identity card of the patient, the symptoms, the medical journey, the successful or unsuccessful drugs, the analysis results and the positive or rejected diagnoses. The “patient support personal record” can also be a tool for patients to set and prepare questions for the medical specialist in order to set short-term, mid-term and long-term goals together.</p>
<p>When the paper version of the PSPR was finally released in summer 2019, the question of the digital version arose.</p>
<p><strong>From paper to digital:  UniRares, LivingLab and the HES-SO Valais Wallis take the digital PSPR project forward. </strong></p>
<p>As you may have seen in the newspapers, the electronic patient record (EPR) is being led by hospitals from the Swiss Romandie under the name of “CARA”, in particular by HUG and CHUV. CARA is expected to launch and to become publicly available this year. It will greatly facilitate the relationship among health care professionals, and will provide a continuous access to everyone to its medical record. All this in a legal clear framework, and within a validated and common exchange protocol. This is a huge step for us, as patients.</p>
<p>In spring 2020, thanks to a working partnership between LivingLab and the HES-SO Valais Wallis, the digital PSPR project has been taken forward.</p>
<p>Yannick Mermod &#8211; a final-year student from the section “Information System”, supervised by Dr. Prof. Michael Ignaz Schumacher and Benjamin Nanchen &#8211; Living Lab Manager, has chosen to work on a Web Application for the PSPR as part of his Bachelor thesis, and to make it more extensive than the EPR. More extensive, as the amount of data for patients suffering from rare diseases is more important than for other patients.</p>
<p>A patient suffering from a rare disease needs solutions adapted and designed accordingly to his own needs and specificities. His life is filled with administrative paperwork required by his health condition, over-complicated and absurd insurance pathways and countless medical appointments.</p>
<p><strong>Usability and Privacy-centricity are the key components to  design a complete and up-to-date medical record, easy to be used on a daily use.</strong></p>
<p>UniRares is convinced that the rare disease patient must have a complete and up-to-date medical record to facilitate its daily use. His data must be at the same time secure and easy to share.</p>
<p>As part of his Bachelor work, Yannick has analyzed the needs of UniRares and has selected the platform PrYv (<a href="http://www.pryv.com">www.pryv.com</a>) to meet the requirements in terms of data storage. Mr. Pierre-Mikael Legris &#8211; PrYv co-founder, has demonstrated a high interest for this project, and has contributed to the project by sharing his knowledge of the platform and helping Yannick in designing the right data model.</p>
<p><strong>The very first Web Application of the “patient support personal record” &#8211; UniRares is ready to be launched.  </strong></p>
<p>It is thanks to these enriching encounters and the close collaboration between the different partners of the PSPR that Yannick Bachelor&#8217;s work has given rise to the Beta version in web format of the &#8220;personal patient assistance file&#8221; &#8211; UniRares. In order to make it available to its members, the next step will be to obtain support and funding to finance the improvement of the technology, as well as the hosting of the application and associated data, while guaranteeing privacy and confidentiality.</p>
<p>UniRares knows that patients suffering from rare diseases or without diagnoses are the weakest. Hence its wish to develop a mentoring program between UniRares members to set up and run this “patient support personal record”, while benefiting from each other’s experience.</p>
<p>This idea of mutual help is the DNA of the association.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Data Residency: where the</b><b> home for your data is.</b></p>
<p><b>Data Localization: a business choice or a legal obligation?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We live in a world where information can travel across borders within a heartbeat. Yet, if it can be rendered anytime anywhere, it has to be stored somewhere at some point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding out where that somewhere should be can be quite a puzzle to solve. Preferably, you want it to be safe, compliant, as well as economically interesting. But mostly, finding the right location for storing valuable information is a legal conundrum that you will have to solve carefully. Especially when managing the personal data of users from various nationalities, as each country poses different geographic limitations as regards to data residency.</span></p>
<p><b>The challenges of finding a Safe Home for Your Data</b></p>
<p>Organizations might think that this is an easy task. But at a time of global data exchange and the multiplication of data privacy laws, choosing the right place for storing personal data is becoming increasingly challenging.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on their business location, companies will have to address different legal requirements. Depending on the place of residence of their users, different expectations. And depending on the data they collect, even additional constraints and limitations. So how to keep up with all that?</span></p>
<p><b>#1 Address the legal requirements of your business location</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things companies should consider when thinking about data storage location is where they are located and which data-related laws apply to their location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, two things have to be checked: first, the scope of the law, which determines to whom, to what and where the law applies. Second, possible additional provisions such as the ones in the chapter 5 of the GDPR addressing the “</span><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-5/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transfers of personal data to third countries or international organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. Based on these indications, you will be able to get a first idea of what can be done or not within the borders of your country.</span></p>
<p><b>#2 know everything about your users’ location and their data</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another parameter to be taken into account when resolving the issue of data residency is the place of residence of the users and the type of data about them that are being collected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly, because some legislation defines their scope of application according to users’ location (like the GDPR). But also, because users are now more aware about data privacy and start to have higher expectations as to where their data should live. Besides, depending on the data collected, some additional constraints might be added by regional regulatory authorities, like the </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2019/10/13/pourquoi-la-certification-hds-ne-garantit-pas-votre-conformite-au-rgpd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HDS Certification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required for health data hosting in France.</span></p>
<p><b>#3 check the laws surrounding your third-parties&#8217; location</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now for economic reasons, some companies may be tempted to have their data stored in a country that is neither that of the company nor that of their users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, such decisions should be made wisely. </span><a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2020-07/cp200091en.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent Shrems II judgment of the EU Court of Justice (CJEU)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a good example of why transferring data to a third-party country might be problematic as regards to users’ data protection rights. In particular, companies should consider the issue of having personal data transferred within the borders of a country where the law provides government access to these data.</span></p>
<p><b>So where is it, the “right” place for your data?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is it in the EU? the US? Or maybe a little bit of both? Choosing a data storage location should not be a matter of choosing a good compromise for all the data, but choosing the right location for each data separately, so that each user can feel secure about his or her data place of residency. So maybe, the “right” decision might be giving the users a choice as to where their data should live?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now how can we help you with that? Companies can use Pryv.io&#8217;s decentralized design to individually store the personal data they collect according to their users location.</span></p>
<p><b>Take a peek at our solution: </b><a href="https://www.pryv.com/"><b>Pryv.io</b></a><b>’s Regional data hosting distributed model.</b></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><b>Dark Patterns in Action: Privacy-by-design or Deceived-by-design?</b></h4>
<h3><b>Enlightenment in Delusion</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trust in the Internet has been lost. Yet we use technology more than ever before. Every single day, millions of applications are being downloaded and fed by personal data. Whoever knows what it is being used for. We have been promised to be protected. We have heard &#8220;privacy-by-design&#8221; many times now, but have we understood it? Probably we did not. As we are still being deceived-by-design by many applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet things are supposed to have changed. &#8220;Businesses took actions&#8221;, we wish to believe&#8230; And some of them really did. The problem, however, is that we see the majority of companies only partially resolving the personal data management and privacy compliance challenges. Whereas according to the GDPR, privacy should be embedded in every aspect of personal data collecting apps.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting from the very beginning of establishing the relationship between the two parties, through the part that is visible for the users: the UI.</span></p>
<h4><b>The Beauty and the Beast in UI: Privacy-by-design or Deceived-by-design?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UI Design is a big part of today’s software applications. More than a pretty look, it is what allows companies to interact with their users and guide them through their app. In terms of compliance, it is also what allows them to ask for users’ consent and provide their users with the means to execute their rights to privacy. Which is why companies should be careful not to include marketing practices that go against privacy requirements when building their designs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, while we often speak about user-experience and user-engagement, we rarely discuss the “dark patterns”: the tricks used in UI designs to make users do things online that they would normally not do. Have you ever heard about them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark patterns are the tricks that make you:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Consent to things that you are not even aware of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Share more information about you that you really want to, an action that became popular as </span><a href="https://medium.com/@mohityadav0493/privacy-zuckering-deceiving-your-privacy-by-design-d41b6263b564"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Privacy Zuckering”.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Pay for things you didn’t even want to buy in the first place.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/Dark-patterns-born-to-mislead"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark Patterns Examples</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whichever it is, it is highly probable that you have been deceived-by-design many times already. The problem is: while UI design can be used to nudge people into making the best choices for themselves, it can also be used to deceive them into sharing more of their personal data than they would usually like to. But what is the “right” choice for the user?</span></p>
<p><b>Nudging users into making the « right » decisions</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If personal data collecting apps aren’t easy to implement in terms of compliance, they certainly aren’t easy to design in this regard as well. Practically: how to strike the right balance between best marketing practices and data privacy regulations?</span></p>
<p><b>When persuasion becomes manipulation.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the GDPR poses legal frontiers to nudge companies into making the “right” choice for their users, recent studies show that they still have a hard time going against their own business interest especially at a time when data brokerage shows to be a particularly profitable business. Yet, </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/07/23/data-monetization-how-to-profit-from-rightfully-managing-personal-data/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">there are other ways to monetize personal data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and even based on a privacy-approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some pathways and actions are more enticing than others. Of course, it can be fun to use gamification techniques to make an App more appealing and increase users’ engagement, but some lines shouldn’t be crossed. Especially when speaking of mobile health applications. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><a href="https://privacyinternational.org/news-analysis/3986/mental-health-site-sharing-your-personal-data-were-going-after-them"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mental health-websites that sell personal data, such as the results of depression tests, to 3rd parties &#8211; such as the case with Doctissimo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Is it game over? Take it to the next level: Dark Patterns for good</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Light the way. Dark patterns might be properly used. We have seen  typical ‘dark’ patterns, being used for the right reasons, for example in Open Banking. </span><a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/ethically-evil-how-to-use-dark-ux-patterns-for-good-e0af1e0443c9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethically Evil: how to use dark patterns for good </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the question remains: how to strike the right balance between best marketing practices and data privacy regulations?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is all about a shift in Mindset: Achieving privacy should not be seen as a problem, but rather as the goal. So </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/23/consent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make trust your first priority!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And next time you need to implement a new design for your app, start with “what” not “why”, and ask yourself: what is the goal of this application and how to ensure privacy-by-design, turning it into your winning ticket? You’ll be surprised what you can come up with!</span></p>
<p><b>Welcome to Privacy-as-a-State-of-Mind: We had a hand in. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For us at Pryv, achieving privacy is not about resolving compliance, it is the goal: privacy as a norm. As a back-end privacy provider, we can certainly help businesses collecting personal data to embed privacy into their systems, ensuring that the data they are collecting is consented rightly, managed and stored, compliantly. Yet, this is just one side of the coin. Companies have to meet us halfway to build a fully privacy-by-design, compliant solution.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therapeutic help can arrive in different shapes and forms. Thanks to the recent technological advances and creative thinking of health innovators, today, it can even be delivered via gamified mobile applications. This article shed a light on the legal aspects and ethical considerations to be addressed when using gamification in mental mhealth apps.</span></i></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level up: light on the legal and ethical aspects of using </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gamification in mental mhealth apps</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental Health has been seen as the “</span><a href="https://www.holmusk.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cancer of tomorrow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. The pandemic further strengthened the suppressive force turning this prediction into a reality. As for their part, researchers even show that there is an unprecedented increase in stress, anxiety and depression. And in the blink of an eye, tomorrow suddenly became today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the context of mental illness, there is no “risk group” as it can hit us all &#8211; our children, co-workers, family members. The damages and consequences are long-term, life-threatening and life-changing. So, not a surprise, among other digital health applications accelerated during the pandemic, a number of mental health applications got their momentum to deliver on their promise: a click away to mental health and well-being. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the promise delivered?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While there is a robust growth of mental mhealth apps offerings, their usage seems to remain inconsistent.</span></p>
<p><b>Do people trust mental mhealth apps? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe “not”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust is the very first principle that allows for engaging users in sharing enough data so that they can be given help. Yet today, people may be skeptical to engage with an app that keeps track of their mental health data and </span><a href="https://privacyinternational.org/news-analysis/3986/mental-health-site-sharing-your-personal-data-were-going-after-them"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rightly so</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For these apps to work then, trust needs to be won first. Nevertheless, trust itself isn’t enough &#8211; people need to put in the work to get better. This requires consistency and the right amount of motivation to do so.</span></p>
<p><b>Do people use mental mhealth apps with consistency?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Maybe “not”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consistency is key for progress. The problem is: keeping users motivated and consistent while being tied up to their homes, forced into quarantine and limited to zero family reunions or social activities is not a piece of cake. To keep them going, you need them to want to engage with your app, just like they would when choosing to play a video game: because it is fun, not seen as an obligation, and it might even fill them with motivation and a positive mindset… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what if winning over mental health could become as entertaining as playing a video game? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encouraging consistency in using mental mhealth applications through gamification has become a trend among digital health innovators. </span></p>
<p><b>“Games with purpose”: Embedding gamification into mental health applications</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gamification is used as a tool for influencing behavior modification in many health applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the game elements introduced in the app, users are enticed to be more engaged in their own recovery, which makes it a formidable tool against mental health disorders. When used in this context, it can further help the users develop healthy habits that can reduce stress, anxiety or depression, such as exercising regularly or following treatment instructions.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-video-games-coronavirus-pandemic-mental-health-disorder-2020-4?r=US&amp;IR=T"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video game makers have banded together to promote gaming as a healthy means of physical distancing and social connection amid the coronavirus pandemic.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the reasons it has become so popular in mental mhealth apps is that smartphones are excellent </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3595405/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delivery vehicles for gamification in healthcare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: easy collection of precious personal data like geolocation, inbuilt accelerometers to monitor activity and external sensors that can capture vital signs such as heart rate and blood pressure are just a few to mention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, not surprisingly, while the pandemic has inflicted income declines on many industries, video games and digital health are not among them. Nowadays, combining the two might even be the best shape for providing help to the ones who need it the most, “stay at home”-compliant. So is it checkmate? Maybe not. One thing is for sure, embedding gamification in mental mhealth apps does not come that easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(spoiler alert:</span><b> privacy is calling!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><b>Legal aspects and ethical considerations of using gamification in mental health applications</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If mental mhealth apps may feel like a funny game to the users, for the one who designs it, the app is nonetheless a digital therapeutic and personal data collecting tool which needs to comply with a number of regulatory requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For personal data collection, privacy and data protection regulations such as the GDPR, CCPA or any relevant national Data Protection Act (DPA) depending on the business and users locations will have to be addressed. As regards to health data, more specific requirements may have to be added to the list, like the</span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2019/10/13/pourquoi-la-certification-hds-ne-garantit-pas-votre-conformite-au-rgpd/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">HDS Certification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required for health data hosting in France. And if the app is recognized as a medical grade solution within the EU, the new EU </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/02/25/get-your-mdr-compliance-done-right-explained-in-3-minutes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MDR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might even come into play. On a brighter note, if targeting the german market, you might also consider applying for </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/03/23/conquering-the-german-market-diga-fast-track-kit-for-digital-health-innovators/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">your app to be prescribed as a treatment and reimbursed by insurance companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parallel to this, the “influencing the behavior of your users”-part of gamification is not to be taken lightly. Alongside the legal aspects cited above, ethical considerations should be given:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Design for Trust:</b>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s simple: if your users don’t trust you, they won’t provide you with their most sensitive, personal information about their mental health and state. Neither will they feel comfortable enough to use your app with consistency. You need trust for your app to work, so build your app around it &#8211; design it for trust.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not about turning your dev team into </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/07/28/embedding-privacy-into-software-applications/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the new lawyers to be</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But embedding privacy in all aspects of your mental mhealth app so it is trustworthy, lawful, and so that your users know what it is done with their data at every step of the way.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Little tip about that: </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/23/consent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enhancing trust requires rethinking consent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><b>Avoid Dark Patterns, unless For Good: </b></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be mindful of the impact you have on users’ choices and their behaviour. While it is one thing to motivate your users through games and a user-friendly interface, it is another to get consent over addiction. Even through games, rightfully ask for consent and don’t let the prospect of a quick profit blind you. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, recent studies show that despite the recent upsurge in privacy and data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA&#8230;), companies still have a hard time going against their own business interests. So is it game over?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe not! Take it to the next level: use </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/08/03/50-shades-of-dark-patterns-to-deceive-privacy-regulations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark Patterns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Good.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><b>Digital Ethics</b></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respect the moral principles &#8211; don’t take the game too far. While gamification can help, it can also have devastating impacts on users, such as inducing depression and crushing attention span. Be careful not to get carried away while “playing the game” and rely on digital ethics to build “games with purpose”.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish norms dedicated to ensure that the autonomy and dignity of users is respected. It is not all on your development team to understand what “ethics” and “privacy” means technically. Provide them with the </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2019/12/08/10-facts-developers-should-know-when-developing-personal-data-collecting-apps/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to implement it “rightly”.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, allow your users to shape the debate and make informed choices.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>#tip:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Walk the talk and keep on your promises to build long-term engagement.</span></p>
<p><b>Play hard, play fair. Respect the rules with Pryv</b></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a world awash with data, investing in personal data-fueled businesses is exponentially growing. Digital Health, Fintech, Insurtech companies that are providing behaviour-based services and solutions are just a few that are trending among them. Prior to investing, however, investors need to know that these enterprises are worth the risk. In the context of personal data-fueled businesses, this means ensuring that their portfolio companies will not hit the wall due to poor data management and misuse of the data. </span></i></p>
<h3><b>Beyond the market-product fit. Details that matter.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors focus their attention on verifying the product-market fit and rightly so. Equally they look at the power of innovation, team execution capacity and specific technology components, such as AI to unlock the data capacity. However, (excluding those specialized in </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/almost-10b-invested-in-privacy-and-security-companies-in-2019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PrivacyTech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example), verifying the scalability in managing data and privacy rightly is rarely on the top of investors’ minds.</span></p>
<p><b>Still, a company’s ability to properly manage its data can tell you a lot about its future. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while you are not expected to become the new privacy experts in town, evaluating certain data management criteria should help you ensure that these companies are managing the personal data they collect rightly, compliantly to relevant privacy regulations.</span></p>
<h3><b>Asking the right questions to get the right answers:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are only 3 Questions away to de-risk when investing in personal data-fueled businesses.</span></p>
<h4><b>Checklist:</b></h4>
<h4><b>#1 Does the company embed a privacy-first approach in the company mind-set and product design? </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflecting the situation: the GDPR, CCPA and numerous changes that are being made into existing data protection regulations are a sign that most companies still are behind when it comes to embedding privacy into their digital applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside the rising concerns around companies’ </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21353232/twitter-ftc-fine-misused-email-phone-advertising-2011-settlement"><span style="font-weight: 400;">misuse of the data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the current shift in users’ tolerance with regard to the disrespect for their privacy needs to be addressed. In a &#8220;user-first&#8221; world, lacking trust results in poor business offerings, limited access and less data sharing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No valuable data for a data-fueled business means </span><b>no return in investment for an investor.</b></p>
<h4><b>#2 Does the company master its personal data lifecycle: from collection, structure, storage, sharing and deletion?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mastering <a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/27/data-lifecyle-management/">the personal data lifecycle</a> is what allows companies to have a proper oversight of what is happening within their organization in terms of data. For a data-driven enterprise, this is today an absolute necessity; first in regard to compliance, but also for everything else:</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does the organization precisely understand what EXACT VALUE the collected data already brings to the organization so that they can build an efficient data monetization strategy?</span></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does their system have interoperability capabilities to allow easy integration and manage diverse data-sets? Can it SCALE over time?</span></i></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do they properly address all the current regulatory requirements? Are they ready to ADAPT to forthcoming changes?</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before investing, be sure to ask your prospective companies these few questions to ensure that they master how the personal data they collect is managed throughout their organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, it is a good indicator that they are ready to scale overtime and thrive in </span><a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/the-rise-of-the-privacytechs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the “Techs”-era</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h4><b>#3 Does their technology allow for privacy-preserving globalization?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, legal interoperability is nothing less but a necessity to scale up any data-driven business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet with the multiplication of privacy laws and related obligations as regards to <a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/08/03/data-residency-insights-on-where-to-store-the-personal-data-you-collect/">data residency</a>, growth in user base and new partnerships that imply for the data to be transferred somewhere new are only a few among the multiple scenarios that make it particularly difficult for a data privacy unconscious business to adapt afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A privacy-preserving globalization approach will help ensure that<a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/23/consent/"> business growth opportunities won’t turn into an issue, but a success.</a></span></p>
<h3><b>Why is privacy important ?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, privacy is not about compliance only. Privacy is about data ethics, business values, and how much trust you can put into a company that collects and processes personal data.</span></p>
<h3><b>Investment is(n’t) blind.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like in love, a long-lasting relationship does not rely on first-sight, but trust. As you probably wouldn&#8217;t marry someone that you don’t trust, we bet you wouldn’t want to invest in a business you have doubts about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same logic, when investing in a data-fueled business, better ask yourself before moving further: Would you be the one to trust this business with your family personal data?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope the checklist above will help you make the right choices for profitable investments.</span></p>
<h3><b>Opt-in with Pryv</b></h3>
<ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to ensure that the companies you perform due-diligence on will not fail on managing their data rightly? Can their business scale over time and geographies?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you consider investing in a technology which does scale across industries and regulations?</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Privacy-preserving-by-design using Pryv.io software, the OKCARDIO<sup>TM</sup> smartapp by HeartKinetics allows patients to easily monitor the cardiac function from home in less than 2 minutes, saving time travelling to the hospital and receiving more frequent analysis. </strong></p>
<p><em>Lausanne, Switzerland / Gosselies, Belgium – October, 2020 The Swiss leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, Pryv, was selected by The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) Inventor Award winner of 2017, the Belgium provider of daily home cardiac monitoring solution, HeartKinetics, to embed granular patient consent management and ensure data privacy compliance with existing and forthcoming regulations.</em></p>
<p>Being one of the companies incubated at <a href="http://www.esa.int/Applications/Telecommunications_Integrated_Applications/Business_Incubation/ESA_Business_Incubation_Centres7">ESA BIC Belgium</a><em>,  </em>based on over 10 years of research on astronaut cardiac function and its deconditioning in microgravity, HeartKinetics drives a real change for more than 121 million people living with cardiovascular disease (CVD) by turning frequent hospital visits for cardiac monitoring into a thing of the past. Instead, thanks to the advances made in the smartphone motion sensors and over 10 years of space research, patients can be diagnosed quickly or monitored remotely when they are discharged from the hospital. OKCARDIO in particular provides over six vitals parameters including breathing rate, heart rate and heart rate variability as well as exclusive cardiac strength and kinetic energy as signs of the mechanical and hemodynamic function.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“For the cardiologist, it is essential to assess both the heart’s rhythm function, and the mechanical function, which is usually done with echocardiography and lengthy examinations. Although there are many wearables for rhythm assessment, there is no such solution for the mechanical function assessment of the heart. Being able to provide a complete overview of the cardiac function with a simple smartphone is ground-breaking. Using Pryv.io technology, we can ingest different types of high frequency data streams concurrently and efficiently, without compromising on privacy and security.“ &#8211; says Pierre-François Migeotte, CEO at HeartKinetics.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>HeartKinetics presents two solutions, the OKCARDIO<sup>TM</sup> smartphone app that measures myocardial activity through the smartphone’s motion sensors, accelerometers and gyroscopes, which, when placed on the chest, can record myocardial contraction efforts and rhythm. The second one, “the KINO<sup>TM</sup>” portable device, is a medical device made of two units, one of which is placed on the chest and the other on the lower back. After an initial calibration by a cardiologist, patients can take measurements at home in less than two minutes and transmit them for diagnosis via a smartphone or tablet. This provides an accurate assessment of both mechanical and electrical myocardial functions, together with hemodynamic parameters.  Based on the patient’s consent, captured and managed by Pryv.io technology,  KINO can frequently share information about a patient’s cardiac health status with their healthcare teams  which is essential for the management of heart failure.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>People living with cardiovascular disease have been among those affected the most during the pandemic. It became clear that there is an urgent need to bring remote monitoring solutions for performing cardiac function tests at home. HeartKinetics addresses such a need with an easy-to-use, breakthrough, scientific-proven technology, already tested and validated, that makes remote heart monitoring possible in a quick and efficient way, from the comfort of the patient&#8217;s home. In addition, patients can easily communicate with their physicians and share their data confidently among medical teams with full respect of the data privacy.</em>&#8221; says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv SA.</p></blockquote>
<p>Preserving privacy in remote health is not a miracle, but the way to be: Pryv.io’s privacy by design technology provides a robust, secure and consent-based backend solution that is designed to prove this. Moreover, the Pryv and HeartKinetics collaboration confirms that it is possible to empower doctors and patients with a deep respect for the confidentiality of the data.</p>
<p>The combination of HeartKinetics health innovation and Pryv.io privacy technology brings light to a critical issue in a time of emerging need. It provides a sustainable, pandemic-proof healthcare solution that is aligned with stringent data privacy requirements.</p>
<p>The KINO device has already been used in clinical trials in the Netherlands Germany and Belgium. OKCARDIO is in its final stage of clinical validations and will be available in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Pryv and CYSEC launch an integrated privacy-preserving solution for collection and confidential computing of personal data at scale.</strong></p>
<p>Lausanne, Switzerland – October 6<sup>th</sup>, 2020</p>
<p><em>Two leading Swiss providers of privacy and security solutions, Pryv and CYSEC, announce a strategic collaboration focused on integrating their products: the personal data &amp; consent management middleware Pryv.io and the confidential computing solution ARCA from CYSEC. The two Swiss trust-tech companies are jointly pursuing strategic opportunities as part of their growth strategies.</em></p>
<p>Businesses operating in highly regulated markets such as healthcare, insurtech, mobility and fintech collect, use, and store sensitive personal data at scale. They must therefore adopt the highest privacy and security standards to ensure that data remains protected throughout the full lifecycle and across all three states of data: data at rest, in transit and in use. The need for secure data management has spawned a new era of data protection and privacy regulation and practices including: GDPR; Swiss DPA; CCPA, PIPEDA. And more stringent regulation will follow.</p>
<p>Organizations face regulatory constraints at many stages of software design and must make decisions on how best to manage access control rights, provide data auditing capabilities and store / host data.  As more organisations and entire industries embrace the collection of personal data and its processing, they too will become subject to highly stringent regulations.</p>
<p>While the collection and use of personal data has become increasingly mainstream, only few organisations have invested in reliable data management and storage solutions that provide the necessary security and privacy. Most organisations remain without protection. The risk is not only a potential fine of 20M EUR or more, but also losing the trust of users. Once lost, user trust and an organisations reputation are very hard to regain. To avoid this, it is imperative to work with the right privacy and security tools.</p>
<p>The Pryv.io Personal Data &amp; Privacy Management Software allows businesses to build digital solutions that can collect, store, share and rightfully use personal data. It comes with must-have consent and auditing tools to keep the clients compliant with existing and forthcoming regulations.</p>
<p>The ARCA solution leverages certified hardware to secure data in use, enabling sensitive data to be processed inside a trusted execution environment. In this way, data can be processed without exposing it to the rest of the system, reducing exposure of sensitive data and providing greater control and transparency for users. Its main advantage is the ease of integration as it is compatible with modern virtualization tools that software developers use, including Docker, Kubernetes, VMWare. The solution can be deployed in centralized, decentralized and distributed architectures.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Pierre-Mikael Legris</strong>, CEO at Pryv SA said: “By combining ARCA and Pryv.io, companies will blend best of breed security and privacy- by-design technologies for their backend and enhance trust for their customers.”</p>
<p><strong>Florian Wiedmann</strong>, Secure Analytics Manager at CYSEC commented: “Organisations looking to comply with increasingly stringent data regulation require a one-stop solution for all their data security and management needs. Teaming up with Pryv will allow us to achieve this goal: A solution that offers both security and critical data management tools to allow organisations to achieve compliance easily.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Trust is critical for companies that manage personal data. Combining ARCA&#8217;s security and Pryv.io&#8217;s privacy by design technology provide a robust, secure and consent-based backend to achieve trust. The integration of Pryv.io and ARCA provides businesses with an easy to deploy solution to collect, structure, share, use and store personal and sensitive data without compromising on security and compliance. ARCA and Pryv.io are further integrated with <a href="https://build38.com/the-trusted-application-kit/">TAK by Build38.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Open banking: Whereas initially seen as a way to enable exchanges between financial institutions, it is now spreading faster and even beyond expectations.</strong></p>
<p><b><i>Once upon a time </i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">we</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">used to think of banking as private safes and white collars. Today, it is certainly one of the most promising areas for data-driven innovation. Each time a user pays online, it leaves behind a digital trail of information, allowing for infinite data-fueled possibilities. Yet just like banknotes, personal financial data needs to be kept safely. This means in this case: in compliance with the GDPR, Swiss DPA or any other relevant data protection regulation.</span></i><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Open Banking: Mastering privacy &amp; consent  </b><b>to unlock the personal data superpower</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth of personal data usage is exponential and affects almost any industry. On one side of this growth, there are the users who keep calling for more on-click personalised offerings and &#8220;fluidity&#8221; of data transfer. On the other, businesses that are striving to deliver on these demands in the best possible way. Some of these businesses, however, are just kicking off in the personal data economy services accessing. This has been core for the banks and financial industries.</span></p>
<p><b>Banks online &amp; payments: guardians of trust</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pandemic casted a harsh light on the notion of personal data collection and privacy respect, it also further strengthened the boost towards contactless and online paying services. Unlike other industries operating with personal data, the banking industry is fortunate to be one step ahead when it comes to trust: </span><a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2019/03/18/distrust-personal-data-protection/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">people trust banks and other financial entities to safeguard their personal data more than other organizations.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Perhaps for this reason, digital banks and mobile financial applications have been growing like weeds in the past few years; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">trust being the “magic” seed of their super-fast expansion.</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://g.co/kgs/ghN9eF"><b>« Bank 4.0: banking everywhere. Never at a bank »</b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As banking services are being digitized, paying cash is becoming a thing of the past. Twint, Revolut and other “one-click” solutions are becoming the new way to pay for anything, anywhere. And online banking apps are the new go-to for managing bank accounts anytime, “stay home”-compliant and safe. So, if banks were long seen as closed physical places with thick walls and locked doors, they are now becoming prime actors of the rising personal data economy. A rise reinforced by the recent introduction of </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-banking.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Banking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a practice that provides third-party service providers open access to consumer banking transactions and financial data through the use of application programming interfaces (APIs).</span></p>
<p><b>Open Banking Poker Face: Superhero or Supervillain?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open banking introduces a new paradigm that opens up many business opportunities. Whereas initially seen as a way to enable exchanges between financial institutions, it is now spreading faster and even beyond expectations. Unforeseen personal data offerings in a cross-industry corporation arise indeed when personal and financial data is derived and aggregated. And in a world where everything can be bought a click away, derived applications are endless. </span></p>
<p><b>Applications, “Sur-mesure”.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just to mention a few, service providers already suggest personalized offerings based on correlating financial and personal data, like targeted budgets for monthly shopping, savings and loans. Thanks to the data collected through open banking, the app can be made perfect for any user: depending on the stage of your life whether you are a student, a parent, buying property or planning retirement, it will provide you with an offer which suits you best.</span></p>
<p><b>Privacy-first (un)locks Open Banking</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, if Open banking is great for business, it is also referred to as a </span><a href="https://www.paymentssource.com/opinion/open-banking-can-be-a-privacy-nightmare"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nightmare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it comes to privacy. Especially, the system raises questions as regards to the privacy of the users whose data is being shared: do they understand what their data is being used for? Are they given the opportunity to give explicit consent as required by the GDPR? To ensure that open banking will benefit the users and not foster discrimination, strong safeguards have to be put in place.</span></p>
<p><b>Solution: Beyond secrecy, use Pryv.io personal data and consent management solution to enhance your users privacy.</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Personal data aggregation, sharing and processing should be as effective, secure and trustworthy as online banking.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one could argue that not sharing any data would be the best solution to ensure users privacy, we beg to disagree: Privacy doesn’t have to be only secrecy. At Pryv, we envision a world where privacy is the ability to share personal data with awareness, trust and control.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Giving explicit consent to collect and share personal data has per core requirement that users understand which data we are talking about. Trust comes with the ability to check the content of these data and the exchanges between all parties. Like banks that provide detailed reports of all transactions in time, classified in bank accounts” &#8211; Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO of Pryv</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/23/consent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhancing trust requires rethinking consent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In this new paradigm, privacy is not a compliance tick box but an opportunity to break data silos, differentiate products and services, and attract end-users with trust, transparency and empowerment.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pryv.io data model provides all data in &#8220;time series&#8221; contextualised and classified in streams. It is designed to provide the same readability and transparency as your bank report. So anyone could make decisions and check its execution with a minimum of effort.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beat the &#8220;get-user-consent&#8221; fear: start managing your users&#8217; data exactly as the bank manages your money!

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><b>Privacy and Data Monetization: a conflict of interests? Really?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy and data monetization are often seen as two antagonistic concepts. While the privacy-respect represents something that costs time, resources and money, the data monetization on the contrary, is what allows you to bring money </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Thus, when thinking about a successful strategy for bringing economic value to personal data, most companies only think of this data as an asset, and tend to forget about their responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, with regards to privacy and data protection regulations, personal data is certainly more a company’s liability: a duty to comply with a large number of obligations. But what if you could turn these obligations into an opportunity for your company?</span></p>
<h3><b>Challenges of rightfully monetizing personal data</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Monetization is a top priority for any company who makes it its business to collect personal data &#8211; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you want to keep your business afloat, you have to generate money. That’s clear.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, at an age dominated by the freeware business model, thinking of a way to bring economic value to this data while respecting users’ privacy is a real challenge, many would say: how to motivate your users to pay for a service they can have for free elsewhere? Or if free, how to make profits without (unethically) selling their personal data?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it became obvious that selling raw personal data is a very profitable business, there are actually a lot of other ways for companies to monetize their data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, you can use it to reduce your costs and enhance your overall business efficiency. Second, you can use it to keep generating more money: not a surprise, but how to do that with respect to users’ privacy rights? Usually, it is there that the conflict between money and privacy arises.</span></p>
<h3><b>Using Data Privacy to enhance Data Monetization</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing is, reducing data to money will often blind you about its infinite possibilities. In fact, chances are: starting by addressing data privacy issues will even help you enhance your data monetization strategy. Why is that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a first step, you need to realize that just like money, data continuously flows in and out of organisations. And how do you make more money with your actual money? By selling more of your products and services? Sure. But mostly, by having a clear picture of how money runs into your organisation and acting smartly on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a similar way, having a clear picture of your data economy will allow you to be smart about it. You might think of it as an extra task that you don’t want to put your efforts into. But actually, it will demand nothing more that you already have to do: as sorting your </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/27/data-lifecyle-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal data lifecycle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the core part of building your data privacy strategy (which you will have to do to comply with data protection regulations like GDPR).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, just like you can </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/23/consent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">turn your GDPR consent-requirements into an opportunity to build trust with your customers and grow your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can turn your data privacy obligations as an opportunity to find new ways to efficiently monetize the personal data you collect, enabling you to solve two problems at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, so good. But how to build an efficient privacy-preserving data management solution that allows you to meet both your privacy requirements and data monetization goals?</span></p>
<h3><b>Here is our solution: <a href="http://pryv.io">Pryv.io</a> &#8211; a ready-to-use Personal Data Management Platform as foundation to build a compliant, scalable and successful business model</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io is a </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/27/data-lifecyle-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal data management solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allows companies to rightfully collect, store, share and use personal and health data. We make personal data aggregation, sharing and processing as effective, secure and trustworthy as online banking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Built to help companies achieve GDPR and HIPPA compliance, Pryv’s solution addresses all the data privacy requirements that you need to stay ahead of existing and forthcoming regulations, but also provides you with a data model precisely designed to aggregate and distribute multiple sources of information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we understand the value of combining a robust amount of data and diverse datasets is essential for providing personalized offerings, we wanted to provide companies with a way to do it efficiently </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compliantly: we thus designed a data structure that is easy to understand and work with. </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/26/data-pooling-get-the-most-out-of-the-data-you-collect/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data pooling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and data aggregation are among the best Pryv.io&#8217;s capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our solution is customer- and data-centric, which allows any company or startup to have a clear understanding of its data economy &#8211; Everything you need to build a strong and ethical data monetization strategy, while being compliant to the most stringent regulations.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Lausanne, Switzerland &#8211; Paris, France, July 2nd, 2020 – The Swiss leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, Pryv SA, and the leading connected health operator in France, Euris Health Cloud®, announced a strategic partnership for delivering a ready-to-be used solution for rightfully managing and securely storing personal health data.</em></p>
<p><strong>A ready-to-use data management solution to achieve GDPR compliance and meet health data hosting </strong><strong>requirements. </strong><br />
Companies willing to collect and use personal health data can now benefit from a complete, ready-to-use, and scalable solution, offered by Euris Health Cloud® (health data hosting) and Pryv (personal data and privacy compliance middleware). In Europe, the solution combines a certified HDS (*) hosting offer for security and a personal healthcare data management service for privacy, allowing e-health actors to rigorously manage personal health data and quickly create applications that respect the rights of the patient at an attractive cost.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-6593 alignleft" src="http://v4.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pierre-Mikael-Legris-sqr-600x600.jpg" alt="" width="85" height="85" srcset="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pierre-Mikael-Legris-sqr-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pierre-Mikael-Legris-sqr-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pierre-Mikael-Legris-sqr-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pierre-Mikael-Legris-sqr-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pierre-Mikael-Legris-sqr-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pierre-Mikael-Legris-sqr-scaled.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 85px) 100vw, 85px" /></em></p>

<p><em>”Contrary to what companies may believe, the HDS Certification of their hosting provider in no way implies their compliance with the GDPR. All it tells them is that their host offers sufficient data protection </em><em>guarantees.” says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv “The complementarity of HDS hosting and GDPR </em><em>compliance solutions is perfectly illustrated by our partnership with Euris.”</em></p>

<p><em> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-6592 alignleft" src="http://v4.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pedro_LUCAS_CEO_CloudSant_groupeEuris-484x600.jpg" alt="" width="78" height="97" srcset="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pedro_LUCAS_CEO_CloudSant_groupeEuris-484x600.jpg 484w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pedro_LUCAS_CEO_CloudSant_groupeEuris.jpg 516w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 78px) 100vw, 78px" /></em></p>
<p><em>“Combining our expertise with Pryv knowledge and Pryv.io capabilities, we provide a unique and proven off-the-shelf solution that allows companies to achieve an optimal data management and protection solution globally through a new bundle offer for startups and innovative e-health projects.“ says Pedro Lucas, CEO at Euris Health Cloud®.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>With the offerings Cloud Santé® PRIVACY and Cloud Santé® PRIVACY STARTUP by Euris and Pryv, companies operating in Europe can now meet both French HDS and EU GDPR requirements with no expertise required on their part, allowing them to focus on their core business and increase user engagement through trust and transparency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now, you&#8217;ve probably all heard that Pryv.io, the Swiss-made personal data &amp; consent data management solution, <a href="https://github.com/pryv/open-pryv.io">is available Open Source.</a> But what does this mean for your company exactly?</p>
<p>In this article, we will outline the benefits of using open source software to support your development and how Open Pryv.io can support your innovation at no cost.</p>
<h4>Open-source: accessible to all.</h4>
<p>Open-source refers to software solutions whose code is freely available so that everyone can access it. For companies, it means that the code is accessible for their developers, so they can verify how it works and make proof-of-concepts without having to pay for anything.</p>
<p>Especially in the health sector, they are very popular as they tend to solve a lot of recurrent issues, like reducing development costs, interoperability and transparency.</p>
<h4>(1)Transparency as a principle.</h4>
<p>Today, personal data and digital health apps are becoming an indispensable tool of our society. Yet, because they tend to rely on the important collection of personal and health sensitive information, the concerns around their respect to privacy are at preeminent importance. So how to address these concerns efficiently?</p>
<p>By relying on Open Source solutions, you show that you are not afraid to reveal how you manage the personal and health data you collect, and send a strong message of inclusivity which can truly make a difference as regards to your users&#8217; engagement.</p>
<h4>(2) Fast, agile and reliable, at no cost.</h4>
<p>If Open Source is the best solution to achieve transparency, it is also the best solution for startups and innovators who want to be fast, confident and build a compliant, scalable digital health app at a costless price.</p>
<p>Yes, costless. This is certainly one of the primary benefits of relying on Open Source solutions: it costs you nothing. Which is extremely interesting for small businesses who might simply not have the resources to buy off-the-shelf solutions, but not only.</p>
<p>Even if having the resources, you might be interested to make a proof-of-concept before going any further with a spotted solution. And this is definitely another primary benefit of Open Source solution: public accessibility.</p>
<h4>(3) Community Validation: Trust-by-design</h4>
<p>You are not alone.<br />
It is not only a small portion of people who have access to the code, but literally everyone. Which makes it trust-by-design and harder to corrupt as it relies on mutual surveillance and reviews from a very diversified community. But above all, it is an undeniable pledge of confidence for users in general.</p>
<h4>(4) No dependencies.</h4>
<p>Another great advantage of using an open source solution is that you have no dependencies with regards to the company which provides you with the solution. You are not tied to some proprietary code as you could be by using pure proprietary software.</p>
<p>This is definitely a game changer for companies who always wanted to rely on existing off-the-shelf solutions to focus on their core business but couldn’t risk to be tied to the hazards or change-of-mind of another business.</p>
<h4>(5) Forward-looking: open possibilities.</h4>
<p>Last but not least, open source is also one of the best strategies to ensure maintaining scalability and flexibility within your organization. With an open code, you will be less exposed to the risk of ending up with obsolete capabilities. Not to mention the fact that it will also encourage open collaboration between your development teams and providers, which can be the fast-tracker you were looking for for creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>Check out how you can build a privacy-by-design digital health app with <a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/06/08/pryv-sa-releases-an-open-source-solution-for-personal-data-privacy-management/">Open Pryv.io</a>: a free, full production, easy-to-install open-source solution for the collection and management of sensitive personal and health data: <a href="https://github.com/pryv/open-pryv.io">https://github.com/pryv/open-pryv.io</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>The release of </b><b><i>Open Pryv.io</i></b> <b>delivers a free, full production, easy-to-install open-source solution for the collection and management of sensitive personal and health data.</b></p>
<p><i>Lausanne, Switzerland, June 9</i><i>th</i><i>, 2020</i> — Today, Pryv SA, the leading Swiss provider of personal data and privacy management software announced the open-source release of <a href="https://github.com/pryv/open-pryv.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/pryv/open-pryv.io&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591767266336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE5M5Nwx5D_-qMstxXIdiLE3h7Y7w"><i>Open Pryv.io</i></a>: a free and scalable personal data lifecycle management platform specifically engineered to empower developers to rapidly create and scale breakthrough, GDPR, and privacy compliant products, services, and experiences.</p>
<p>As developer productivity has become a competitive necessity, the ready-to-use <i>Open Pryv.io</i> is marking a turning point to de-complexify the development of personal data and digital health applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/26/data-pooling-get-the-most-out-of-the-data-you-collect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/26/data-pooling-get-the-most-out-of-the-data-you-collect/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591767266336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFeNPJDzmhUKSKsjHngsGZqfSJQZw">Data pooling</a>, data aggregation, consent management, and data interoperability are among the Open Pryv.io’s capabilities that are raising the bar for delivering a reliable solution for collecting and managing heterogeneous sets of real-world personal data with full respect to privacy.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“Releasing our core software in open-source today is a natural move for us. From day one, Pryv.io was built to be open-sourced” </i>says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO and co-founder of Pryv SA<i>.</i><i> ”</i><i>In fact, our source code has always been open for our clients. </i><i>By releasing Open Pryv.io, we provide any company with a tool allowing them to address the enhanced citizen’s right, which sends a strong message of transparency and inclusivity</i><i>”.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Fostering faster innovation and less duplication of effort are also among the main drivers of Open Pryv.io’s release. Nowadays developers value using open-source instead of redeveloping available code. Integrating Pryv.io open components will allow developers to free them up to work on what is unique in their products and add privacy-by-design to their value proposition.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>Open sourcing our code is doing the right thing – for the community, for our clients, and for Pryv. We should have done it much earlier.” </i>adds Simon Goumaz, Co-Founder and Board Member at Pryv SA.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Open Pryv.io release takes place at a time when the pandemic disruption has cast a harsh light on the notion of personal data collection and privacy respect. <a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/04/20/privacy-and-health-regulation-updates-during-covid-19-must-know-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pryv.com/2020/04/20/privacy-and-health-regulation-updates-during-covid-19-must-know-updates/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591767266336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8KIT8Lzn3rmvbgTUsTeMMlh0whQ">As governments have been lifting data protection restrictions in an attempt to ease access to personal data to protect public health, the release of Open Pryv.io shows that there is a way to encourage personal data collection being done right.</a> Open Pryv.io urges to build a world where privacy is the norm &#8211; not the exception as it is today.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“Privacy doesn’t have to be only secrecy. We envision a world where privacy is the ability to share your data with awareness and control. For years now, we prove that respecting one’s privacy and having access to their data are not contradictory. The more transparent you are, the strongest relationships you will build with your users” </i>says Evelina Georgieva, Co-Founder and CBDO at Pryv SA.<i> “</i><i>No more excuses: the Open Pryv.io offers developers a strong foundation to ensure that the personal data they collect are rightfully managed from day 1.</i><i>”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Alongside this new release, which offers essential features of the <a href="https://www.pryv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pryv.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591767266336000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE-r8KgdLMHIdcEULqtCN1s2XmMsQ">Pryv.io</a> software following an open-core model, Pryv continues executing its growth strategy by licensing the enterprise-class version to projects that require high scalability, compliance documentation and dedicated support.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Master the GDPR Compliance Checklist with Pryv.io</em></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not news: from two years already, if you’re a company operating with EU citizens personal data, you have to comply with the </span></i><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2019/11/20/gdpr-swiss-dpa-e-privacy/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (General Data Protection Regulation). Effective since 25 May 2018, the regulation sets out a number of legal obligations to be met in terms of privacy requirements and generous fines to be paid for those who don’t play by its rules. Yet in spite of its not-so newness, a lot of questions are still arising when it comes to GDPR compliance: how to achieve it? Where to start? How to leverage its requirements into a competitive advantage?</span></i></p>
<p><b> Master the GDPR Compliance Checklist with Pryv</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While lots of companies see the GDPR as a boring legal conundrum to solve, it is actually one of the best frameworks you can use to flourish and scale up your business. That is of course, assuming you do it smartly; we bet you would rather use your resources to enhance your application than have them stuck finding a way to answer on the user&#8217;s rights on their data: how to execute their consent, where to store their data&#8230; getting a copy of the data ready, process to delete it? At the end of this article, you’ll be the one ready to master your GDPR compliance and know how Pryv.io’s capabilities can help you thrive in the blooming personal data economy.</span></p>
<p><b>GDPR 101: a checklist to achieve compliance</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make it easier for companies to navigate the storm of the GDPR data protection and privacy requirements, the </span><a href="https://gdpr.eu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gdpr.eu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website provides easy-to-understand, compliance guidance through a variety of digital content aiming at explaining and/or highlighting the specifics of the regulation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Especially, they provide a free, online </span><a href="https://gdpr.eu/checklist"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR Compliance Checklist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that businesses can use as a framework to achieve their own compliance. </span><b>This is exactly where you want to start when asking: &#8220;Am I ready for the GDPR?&#8221;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divided in four parts, the checklist sets out a list of 19 things to be checked or done (preferably before going to market!) in order to reduce the risks of regulatory penalties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The checkups are regrouped by privacy-related “themes”:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawful </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">basis and transparency</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Security</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accountability </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and governance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy rights</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following, we will show for each of these checkups how you can leverage our technology to achieve GDPR compliance while increasing your business efficiency.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it is your job to ensure that your customers can enact their rights, on our side, we provide you with the functionalities to execute them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Built with a user-centric approach, Pryv is designed to ensure these functionalities while maximizing software performance and business efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Pryv.io allows you to provide your users with the option to backup their data on their computer or transfer it to another company (data portability, as requested by checkup #17).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(For example, we developed a ”</span><a href="https://bluebutton.pryv.me/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blue button</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” app, which will allow the data to be exported as JSON files and packed inside a password protected zip file in one click.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Pryv.io proposes a specific mode that enables isolation of per-user data in back-ups for deletion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our software is privacy-by-default (default opt-out). This is made to ensure that your users have an explicit choice as to accept or object to the processing of their data. All processes have a 1-to-1 relationship with the users of the App, allowing them to update or revoke their consent at all times. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is dynamic consent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a plus: you can further de-risk your compliance with the Pryv.io </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/25/audit-logs-in-pryv-io-when-every-single-piece-of-information-matters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data-audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> embedded feature &#8211; so that beyond allowing your users to benefit from their lawful rights, you can also prove that they were respected and executed rightly.</span></td>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><b>Urgent search to integrate eConsent and provide virtual tools for clinical trial use.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If traditional clinical trials were already on the spot for a digital upgrade, the pandemic/lockdown situation made it now a top priority for the global healthcare industry. Especially, if researchers want to pursue their studies while keeping participants safe at home, they have to go digital and adopt eConsent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, what can be easily done when meeting in real life can be difficult to achieve technically. This is especially true for consent. </span></p>
<h3><b>Consent under trials</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Informed consent&#8221; is the solid basis for any clinical trial. That is, the consent that an investigator must obtain prior to any experiment on a participant. W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ithin the EU, this process is governed by the Clinical Trials Directive, soon to be replaced by the Clinical Trials Regulation (CTR).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Directive, “informed consent” shall be defined as follow: “decision, which must be written, dated and signed, to take part in a clinical trial, taken freely after being duly informed of its nature, significance, implications and risks and appropriately documented, by any person capable of giving consent”. As for the CTR, it provides us with a similar definition: “informed consent means a subject&#8217;s free and voluntary expression of his or her willingness to participate in a par­ticular clinical trial, after having been informed of all aspects of the clinical trial that are relevant to the subject&#8217;s decision to participate”, and also adds that “informed consent shall be written, dated and signed”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, in order to enrol participants in a clinical trial, investigators must obtain their consent first, and are obliged by the law to provide them with all relevant information. We certainly all can picture how it would look like when an investigator and a participant meet in real life. The participant will come where the study takes place. Shake hands with the person in charge. See with his eyes how everything happens. And then they will talk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At some point, some paperwork will be involved, and all the processes will be documented as it is required by the law. The participant will then be left with the choice to consent or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now how do you implement that virtually? This is where eConsent solutions come in.</span></p>
<p><b>eConsent</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electronic consent (eConsent) is the virtual equivalent of consent. So instead of having  people meeting each other in order to exchange information and sign a piece of paper, everything is done remotely. Which is exactly what we need in a time of a pandemic disruption, and also to increase the potential and success of clinical trials in general, as it would open infinite possibilities for real world data collection and worldwide participants recruitments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">eConsent allows patients to continue consenting and enrolling in clinical trials when not being able to present in person, whether due to an isolation, physical condition or geographic location. </span></p>
<h3><b>However, contrary to popular belief, eConsent is way more than a &#8220;checking a box&#8221; option &#8211; especially within the context of a clinical trial.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even virtually, the law applies and obliges investigators to inform the participants, document everything, and so on. But more importantly, if you are looking to enroll participants into a decentralized and remote clinical trial, <a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/23/consent/">you will have to build a digital trust.</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3><b>Solution: Pryv.io Privacy &amp; eConsent Solution to build trust for your remote clinical trial.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a digital trust is the key to unlocking the difficulties of remote recruitment. When running a digital trial, you have to keep in mind that basically, you are asking people that you’ve never met to consent that you experiment on them. That certainly doesn’t bring much confidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So be innovative, adopt technology, provide more value. Just because you “have to” go digital doesn’t mean that you can not take this as an opportunity to push back the barriers and overcome the limitations of the current traditional on-site paper-based clinical trials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a call. Use telehealth solutions to meet virtually. Build a virtual path to follow that will put your participants in the same situation that they would be if they would come to meet you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Now how can we help you?</strong> Companies can deploy Pryv.io as a foundation for their digital clinical trials. Our software is specifically engineered to empower CRO and Pharma organizations to design and run decentralized, remote and patient-centric clinical trials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you focus on designing the perfect user interface for your patients, we provide you with a data management platform ready to welcome unlimited types of data from unlimited devices. So you can use IoT, medical devices and wearables to capture real-world data at any time, enabling you to unleash new discoveries during your trial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t access or host any data. You and your participants can even choose in which country you want the data to be stored &#8211; our platform is specifically designed to run multi-centric clinical trials at ease. Once stored, the data will be kept per-user, so you can easily show each participant his trial dataset and engage them in the process, sending a strong message of transparency and inclusivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our <a href="https://www.pryv.com">Pryv.io platform</a> also comes with eConsent and auditing tools so you can rapidly cook-up your own digital informed consent in compliance with CTR and GDPR. Our eConsent mechanism will allow you to keep track of every consent and related data-access per participant, while our audit solution will enable you to document the full process and retrace every access to the data.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Lausanne/Switzerland, Munich/Germany 5th May, 2020 – The Swiss leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, Pryv SA, and Build38 GmbH, the global provider of mobile application protection solutions, announced a strategic collaboration to address the growing demand for security and privacy compliance for the Digital Health and InsurTech Industry. </em></p>
<p><strong>Security with app hardening and privacy-by-design backend are a top priority for </strong><strong>Digital Health Providers</strong></p>
<p>Fraud, privacy violations, cyberattacks, unauthorized data collection, outlaw processing, and hacking of connected medical devices and mobile applications are just a few of the threats arising from the digitalization of the healthcare industry. A hack, that can be disastrous for individuals, is just as harmful for businesses, who will face regulatory fines and damage to their reputation. Such threats can be minimized by implementing adequate privacy and security measures right from the very start. Protecting digital channels is invaluable on many levels, saves lives and prevents significant financial losses.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Smartphones and tablets are the primary access point for both our personal and work life, and a valuable target for attackers,” said Dr. Christian Schlaeger, Build38 CEO. “Business agility provided by mobile devices will continue to drive adoption in the mobile health sector, even more now with the announced DiGA initiative of the German government. Build38 and Pryv empower businesses to embrace the productivity benefits of mobile devices while addressing the security and privacy risks.”</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Covid-19 pandemic affected ordinary life in an extraordinary way. Not only it impacted our health, our lifestyle, our economy, but also regulations enforcement. If the governments are still striking to find the right balance between fighting the pandemic and addressing privacy issues, they recognize the urgent need to adapt and are already starting to give updates on existing and forthcoming regulations. Here are the essentials you need to know to navigate the changes (at least for now, we’ll keep you posted!) within regards to managing personal and health data.</span></i></p>
<p>*This is a living document that will be updated on a regular basis.</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6279" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/markus-spiske-wIUxLHndcLw-unsplash-600x354.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="354" /></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR: remaining within the rules.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) says that it is possible to adapt to the situation while remaining within the rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2020/statement-edpb-chair-processing-personal-data-context-covid-19-outbreak_en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data protection rules (such as GDPR) do not hinder measures taken in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic,” says EDPB chair Andrea Jelinek.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“However, I would like to underline that, even in these exceptional times, the data controller must ensure the protection of the personal data of the data subjects. Therefore, a number of considerations should be taken into account to guarantee the lawful processing of personal data.”</span></p>
<p><b>Consent and Data Collection</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Protection Authorities all agree: </span><a href="https://www.complianceweek.com/data-privacy/confusion-around-gdpr-during-coronavirus-prompts-edpb-response/28645.article"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">essential</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> information should be collected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, only in case that it’s necessary for public health reasons, public health authorities and employers can process personal data without having the consent of the concerned individuals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the concept might be simple in theory, it leaves organisations with a lot of questions and challenges to solve. To provide guidance on the subject, International Law Firm White &amp; Case has set out “</span><a href="https://www.whitecase.com/publications/alert/covid-19-and-data-protection-compliance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an overview of some of the key issues for organisations to consider during this crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from an EU data protection compliance perspective”.</span></p>
<p><b>Mobile location data</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">« </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the processing of electronic communication data, such as mobile location data, additional rules apply. The national laws implementing the ePrivacy Directive provide for the principle that the location data can only be used by the operator when they are made anonymous, or with the consent of the individuals</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">» </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">« </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it is not possible to only process anonymous data, Art. 15 of the ePrivacy Directive enables the member states to introduce legislative measures pursuing national security and public security *. This emergency legislation is possible under the condition that it constitutes a necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure within a democratic society. If such measures are introduced, a Member State is obliged to put in place adequate safeguards, such as granting individuals the right to judicial remedy. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">»</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Commission’s Recommendation on apps for contact tracing, published on 8 April and setting out the process towards a common EU toolbox for the use of technology and data to combat and exit from the COVID-19 crisis</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Jelinek, Chair of the EDPB, said: “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EDPB welcomes the Commission’s initiative to develop a pan-European and coordinated approach as this will help to ensure the same level of data protection for every European citizen, regardless of where he or she lives.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/letters_en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letter concerning the European Commission&#8217;s draft Guidance on apps supporting the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its letter, the EDPB specifically addresses the use of apps for the contact tracing and warning functionality, because this is where increased attention must be paid in order to minimise interferences with private life while still allowing data processing with the goal of preserving public health.</span></p>

<h3><b>MDR: Postponed. </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parliament adopted the European Commission proposal, allowing the application of the Medical Devices Regulation to be postponed by one year until 26 May 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">«</span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This postponement will take the pressure off national authorities, notified bodies, manufacturers and other actors so they can focus fully on urgent priorities related to the coronavirus crisis.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, said: “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortages or delays in getting key medical devices certified and on the market are not an option right now. The Commission is therefore taking a pragmatic approach and delaying the entry into application of new EU rules on medical devices, so we can have our medical industries pouring all their energy into what we need them to be doing: helping fight the pandemic. This shows once again that the European Union is leaving no stone unturned in our support to national public health systems in their hour of need.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authorities, in cooperation with health institutions, are doing everything possible to stem the rapid spread of the coronavirus.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Guidance stresses that employers may not implement measures to fight against the coronavirus pandemic that would infringe on employees’ or visitors’ right to privacy, especially by collecting personal health data that would go beyond what is necessary to determine potential exposure to the virus. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its newly adopted Digital Healthcare Act (DHA; Digitale‑Versorgung‑Gesetz, DVG), Germany now positions itself as a top country for digital health innovation. Telemedicine and digitization are becoming the new normal. Funding options are increasing to push back the barriers of digital health innovation. While the Germans were already known for their robust and above-average effective healthcare system, the DHA will now make their healthcare market more attractive than ever, unleashing countless new opportunities for digital health startups and innovators. But how do you conquer such a market?</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#1 What you need to know to successfully scale-up your digital health innovation in Germany</span></h2>

<h4><b><i>The German Healthcare Market &#8211; Overview</i></b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the largest European healthcare system counting 72 million insured citizens, Germany has always been a very attractive market for health actors, not only for internal players, but also globally. However, until now, breaking into the digital health market was legally more challenging than rewarding, making it very difficult for health startups and entrepreneurs to pioneer into the German eHealth scene. It all changes now with the adoption of the Digital Healthcare Act.</span></p>
<h4><b><i>The Digital Healthcare Act &#8211; What’s new?</i></b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Digital Healthcare Act was adopted in 2019 by the German Parliament and entails the new rules to support digital health innovation in Germany. If the German healthcare system was strong thus far, it was also filled with paperwork and not legally welcoming in regard to digital innovation. The new Act addresses these issues and opens the German healthcare market to a new era of digitization and unlimited possibilities for groundbreaking eHealth solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting from January 2020, the Act will bring revolutionary changes to the German Healthcare Community, opening the doors to infinite opportunities for the visionary eye. Among them:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full digital transformation of the healthcare system;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telemedicine becoming the new normal;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctors prescribing Apps as a Treatment.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><b><i>Pioneering Health Data &#8211; Laws to follow?</i></b></h4>
<p><b><i><br />
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the many possibilities that the DHA offers, unleashing the power of digitization over healthcare involves a lot of risks for personal health data and patients. Companies that are taking the leap into pioneering health data will have to comply with several standards and Regulations in order to ensure that patients are safe and data are secured. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Regulatory framework on top of your new eHealth Solution will be composed of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EU Regulations: mostly </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2019/11/20/gdpr-swiss-dpa-e-privacy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/02/25/get-your-mdr-compliance-done-right-explained-in-3-minutes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MDR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ensuring data protection and product safety.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">German Data Protection laws: specifying data protection over GDPR.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laws deriving from the DHA itself: like the Patient Data Protection Law that is in motion or the DiGA Ordinance if you were targeting to prescribe a Digital Health App (DiGA).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical Professional Secrecy.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is worth highlighting that Data Protection Standards within the German healthcare system are extremely strict. Health app providers will have to prove that their systems have been designed with respect to the state-of-the-art data protection and data security requirements</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">#2 </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to ensure that your Digital Health Innovation gets adopted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and reimbursed in Germany</span></h2>

<h4><b><i>Software as a Treatment &#8211; New opportunities?</i></b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among all the changes that the DH Act will bring to the German healthcare system, one that will massively and positively impact eHealth innovators and entrepreneurs is the one that </span><b>allows doctors to prescribe medical apps</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By making Digital Health Apps (“DiGA” in DHA) a treatment, the new Act establishes a right for eHealth Solutions to be prescribed and reimbursed by insurance companies: providing start-ups with the opportunity to re-think and introduce new business models to support their growth.</span></p>
<h4><b><i>Your Digital Health Solution &#8211; Eligible under DHA?</i></b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, not every digital health application will be eligible to become such a care treatment. Eligibility for insurance reimbursement is tied to strict criteria and eHealth Solutions will have to meet specific requirements in order to be recognized as DiGA under DHA, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being patient-centric.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">classified as a class I or IIa medical-grade solution </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/02/25/get-your-mdr-compliance-done-right-explained-in-3-minutes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">under MDR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rely on eTech.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allow for specific medical functionalities as listed in the law.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more details on the subject, companies shall refer to the DiGA Ordinance (DiGAV).</span></p>
<h4><b><i>Insurance Reimbursement &#8211; The Fast Track Process</i></b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now to  have their solution prescribed and reimbursed, makers of Digital Health Apps will have to undergo the “Fast Track Process” in order to be listed in the official DiGA directory. Precisely, they will have to apply to the competent authority and show that their products meet specific General Requirements (including those of GDPR and MDR) and will have “positive care effects”, not only for individuals, but also for medicine and the healthcare system itself.</span></p>
<p><b>The Fast Track Process:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> After a 3-months preliminary period for application review, the BfArM (which is the German Authority that reviews for DiGA applications) will approve temporarily (or not) the product for a 1-year testing period, during which the producers will have to demonstrate the “positive care effects” of their solution in order to be definitively listed in the DiGA directory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes this process particularly interesting for digital health startups is that it is indeed very fast and allows for rapid business growth and evolution:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requests for listing in the DiGA directory are reviewed in a 3-months approximate period, enabling rapid startup evolution if things go well!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-listing is allowed during a one year testing period, so that companies have time to prove positive medical efficiency while having their products on the market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price negotiations are also in order if the testing period is proven to be successful.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2></h2>
<h2><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">#3 Be the first among equals: conquer the new German </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital Healthcare market in a heartbeat</span></i></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the specifics are still in the process of being defined, interested companies can and should already look for eligibility to ensure that they will be the first to benefit among many more to come and compete with. </span><b>We will never emphasize on this enough: Time matters.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you wish for your product to be part of the short-listed portfolio in the beginning of DiGAs era, now is the time to apply and place your solution at the top of German eHealth innovation.</span></p>
<h4><b><i>Being first to last &#8211; requirements</i></b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the easy appearance of the fast-track process, Digital Health innovators will have to work hard to see their Applications accepted (at least temporarily) by the German authorities. Since DiGAs are defined as GDPR and MDR compliant products, meeting the requirements of these regulations will certainly be the first challenges for achieving DiGA-recognition. However, this will only be the top of the iceberg. Producers will also have to </span><b>strike the right balance between scalability and interoperability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ensure that their Apps thrive in the new German digital era.</span></p>
<h4><b><i>German Healthcare 4.0 &#8211; issues to address</i></b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thriving in the 4.0 digital era will certainly not be a breeze for health startups and organizations. With an average of 10 visits per year to their physicians, Germany certainly makes a strong case for a digital makeover, but also raises concerns about privacy and security of the german data. Especially at a time when we are still learning that secured systems are far from being the norm in Germany, regardless of </span><a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/german-regulator-issues-record-fine-for-87518/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">severe GDPR fines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and regular </span><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/sensitive-medical-data-for-13000-germans-was-available-online-for-years/a-50465964"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cyberattacks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the medical industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of state-of-the art privacy, security and data protection standards, organizations will have to tackle scalability and interoperability challenges, which might take time to prepare for. The telematics infrastructure of the German healthcare system and the specifics of <a href="https://www.gematik.de/telematikinfrastruktur/">Gematik’</a>s dedicated computer network should also be addressed. Moreover, data storage and access should be a top priority. Specifically: where to keep the data &amp; how to share it when needed?</span></p>
<h4><b><i>Pryv.io &#8211; DiGA starting kit</i></b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meeting all these requirements is feasible but can be hard for startups. Running over budget, time and resources.… Re-designing, re-focusing&#8230; doing it once again… feeding your migraine, burning your team? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But just imagine: what if … you were given the luxury to focus on what matters the most to roll-out your key value proposition and innovation, while the entire data lifecycle management of your breakthrough eHealth solution is resolved, in no time?</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update May 2020: In regards to Covid-19, the European Parliament adopted the European Commission proposal, allowing the application of the Medical Devices Regulation to be postponed by one year until 26 May 2021</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May 2021, all companies providing healthcare solutions recognized as “medical devices” under the new EU “Medical Devices Regulation” (MDR) will have to comply with newer, stricter requirements, for which they may not be prepared.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of discussions around MDR and how it might affect our customers and digital health innovators inspired us to write this article: summarizing the “must-knows” of MDR for those of you who are still in doubt about the Regulation, or will have to face it in the future. We hope it will help you get confidence on where to get started, and provide you with the keys to get your MDR compliance done right in a simple yet effective way.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">*The <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6145" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/icon-24.png" alt="" width="24" height="24" /> tags below will outline the specific areas of the Regulation where we could provide you with further assistance if needed. But first, let’s get into it.</span></i></p>
<h3>MDR-Checklist:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you a medical (eHealth) device provider?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you operate on the European market?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still not ready for MDR yet?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If all your answers above are “YES”: then now is the time to take action. So what is MDR exactly and how will you prepare for compliance?</span></p>
<pre><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-6146 aligncenter" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Red-v-3.png" alt="" width="356" height="541" /></pre>
<h3></h3>
<h3>MDR, explained.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MDR is the new European “Medical Devices Regulation”. Applying to all companies placing “medical devices” on the European market, it came into force in May 2017 with a 3-year transition period (which is soon to expire) and sets out the new EU rules to ensure safety and performance of med devices within the Union. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, it was designed to bring the EU market to newer safer, higher standards, align with digital health innovation, and put patients safety and transparency at the heart of the EU healthcare industry.</span></p>
<p><b>Simply explained, MDR works like this:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it classifies “medical devices” according to risks and then defines the appropriate legal requirements for each class. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By “medical devices”, MDR means: any instrument or software that is intended to be used for some specific predefined medical purposes, such as health diagnosis, treatment or monitoring, including digital health and eHealth diagnostic devices. All targeted “devices” and ”intents” are listed in the regulation. If in doubt about yours, refer to art. 1 &amp; 2 MDR.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To successfully achieve compliance, you will have to understand MDR objectives and how they will impact the affected businesses. Among the main objectives of MDR are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>To improve safety, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">quality and reliability over medical devices: thus, most devices &#8211; maybe yours? &#8211; have been reclassified to higher risks class and will thus need to comply with further requirements in order to stay/be in the EU market.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>To strengthen transparency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of information for consumers: every product placed, put into service or made available on the market will be registered in the EU Database for Medical Devices (EUDAMED) with a “unique device identifier” to keep track of it.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>To enhance vigilance</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and market surveillance: pre- and post-market data collection will be mandatory to prove products efficiency. For that one, we strongly advise to review for </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2019/11/20/gdpr-swiss-dpa-e-privacy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR-compliance, and watch for any other applying regulation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6145" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/icon-24.png" alt="" width="24" height="24" /></span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>The time is now:</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of the date 26 May 2020, MDR will fully apply and replace the existing Medical Devices Directive (MDD) and Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive (AIMDD).</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">All affected companies will have to meet with the new requirements by then.</span></p>

<h2>The 6 steps to compliance:</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve established that you fall under MDR (see MDR flowchart above), here are the 6 steps to achieve compliance:</span></p>

<h3>#1 Product (re)classification:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, check MDR classification rules to determine the right conformity route to follow: should your device be (re)classified in Class I, IIa, IIb or III?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For software devices (Rule 11, Annex VIII MDR), it works like this:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software for diagnosis or therapeutic intent are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Class IIa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, except if involving possible death or irreversible deterioration: then </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Class III</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or a serious deterioration or surgical intervention: then </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Class IIb</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software for physiological processes monitoring intent are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Class IIa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, except if involving vital physiological parameters and possible immediate danger for the patient: then </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Class IIb</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All other software is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Class I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>#2 Notified Bodies<span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If not Class I, a third-party auditor (known in the industry as a “Notified Body”) will be required to assess product’s conformity. You can choose one from <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/nando/index.cfm?fuseaction=directive.notifiedbody&amp;dir_id=34"><b>that list</b></a><b>.</b></span></p>

<h3>#3 Technical file<span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set up and update a technical file that describes your product &amp; reflects on its ability to meet with MDR requirements (that should include clinical evaluation reports, as well as code documentation for “software-devices”). </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6145" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/icon-24.png" alt="" width="24" height="24" /></span></i></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><b>Tip</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: get your clinical data ready, you’ll probably need them before you know it!</span></i></li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h3>#4 Management Systems<span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get a QMS, RMS &amp; PMSS* in place or upgrade to meet with the new requirements. Better be safe than sorry: always be ready to be fully audited! </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6145" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/icon-24.png" alt="" width="24" height="24" /></span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Tip:</i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For digital health solutions: emphasize on code documentation &amp; software security.</span></i></b></li>
</ul>

<h3>#5 EU Declaration of Conformity<span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fill up a document in which you declare that the product satisfies MDR requirements. YOU are responsible for the compliance of your product.</span></p>

<h3>#6 CE marking<span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Get your product “CE marked”, that is, certified with a specific mark that indicates EU conformity. Once done, you’ll be ready to launch your product on the market!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready to comply yet? Now having read this, we hope you will be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get this job done and let us know about your success! </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b><i>The Data LifeCycl</i></b><b>e</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refers to the sequence of stages a specific unit of data undergoes within an organization: from the time it was generated or collected, to the time it was stored, used, shared, archived and deleted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies tend to put their best resources and minds on getting the best product for their users &#8211; it&#8217;s normal. But in doing so, a number of organizations are failing at organizing their data lifecycle. First, it is not a simple task: it’s a blend of legal, IT and business-logic actions which need to be designed to meet current data and regulatory requirements, as well as to last over time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, very often, while focusing too much on the data processing stage, organizations forget about the importance of carefully managing the data at all of its stages, which can rapidly become an issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data without proper management can not only create privacy and security gaps, but also position the entire operations of the company at risk. Not to mention the fact that you would probably get more insights from the data once you&#8217;ll have a clear picture of your company’s entire data economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, having a proper oversight of the data lifecycle stages and how to implement them within your organization is absolutely essential: not only to achieve business efficiency and properly address all relevant privacy and data protection requirements, but also to ensure seamless interoperability and scalability.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does your system have interoperability capabilities to allow easy integration and manage diverse data-sets? Can it scale over time?</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does your system properly address all the current regulatory requirements? Are you ready to adapt to forthcoming changes?</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your company prepared to efficiently handle users’ data requests: “where is my data? Who does access it? Can you delete it?”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you prove that you have executed your users’ rights and consent correctly?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Pryv, we made it our core business to answer these critical questions, and made available for businesses a ready-to-use solution to manage personal data, rightly. </span></p>
<h3><b>Meet Pryv.io:</b> <b>Simple, yet remarkably powerful personal data management platform. </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io is an extensible personal data lifecycle management platform specifically engineered </span><b>to empower businesses </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">to rapidly create and scale breakthrough, privacy compliant products.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its data model is precisely designed to aggregate and distribute multiple sources of information. </span><a href="http://pryv.github.io"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The API</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows you to easily collect and store any type of personal data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dynamic consent and auditing capabilities ensure that beyond allowing your users to benefit from their lawful rights, you can prove that they were respected and executed rightly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralized and per-user data storage distribution are also included as must-have features to guarantee your business scalability across legal environments.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on your core business knowledge and let pryv.io optimize your organization’s resources for a responsible, efficient, and lawful collection, use, sharing and disposal of information.</span></p>
<h4><b>(1) Data Collection: </b><b>Seamless connectivity, interoperability with no-limits.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io allows you to collect data from any source of information, including, but not limited to: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet of things (IoT) devices </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile applications</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Server-side data collection for web-enabled applications</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any other source</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It further supports collecting, aggregating and storing data, such as: files, health metrics, locations, audio samples, notes, pictures, activities… you name it! So that you can collect any type of data you need to fulfill the purpose of your organization &#8211; today, tomorrow, and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we already implemented a various number of </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/event-types/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standard Types</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the data, our customers are allowed to design their own data models and implement it under Pryv&#8217;s conventions if needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To know more about how Pryv.io allows you to collect and aggregate data from multiple sources for a subject, you can take a peek at our </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/guides/data-modelling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Modelling Guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which further explains Pryv’s Data collection.</span></p>
<p><b>Pryv.io High Frequency:</b><b> unleashing IoT Connectivity with High Throughput Data Ingestion.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case data is collected by IoT devices, Pryv goes even deeper and </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2018/03/22/pryv-unleashes-iot-connectivity-with-high-throughput-data-ingestion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unleashes IoT Connectivity with High Throughput Data Ingestion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ingesting data at almost any speed your underlying system allows, making storing data at high frequency a breeze for your organization.</span></p>
<h4><b>(2) Data Aggregation and Structure:</b><b> All data is kept per-user, total control over privacy</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The value of combining a robust amount of data and diverse datasets is essential for providing personalized offerings. We understand that and offer you a way to do it efficiently, compliantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inherently, all data is collected at a specific moment in time. We thus designed a data structure that approaches all collected data as &#8220;time-stamped data&#8221;, providing companies with an interoperable structure that is easy to understand and work with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This extendable and scalable solution allows for unlimited types of data to be structured in a unified model and organized hierarchically, enabling the data to bring meaningful insights to organizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on “streams” and “events”, pryv.io provides a unique ontology (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv SA know-how and trade secret, labelled as fully “Swiss made” technology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) that allows for interoperable structure designed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to serve Privacy and Development Teams.</span></p>
<p><b>Pryv.io Data Model: </b><b>Data structures for interoperability</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To let data be easily understood and exchanged across systems, we provide an open directory of standard types, which we recommend developers use when interoperability is a concern </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/data_in_pryv/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(read more</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<h4><b>(3) Data Storage: </b><b>Decentralized design to span the globe with no bottleneck.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations should always know what data they are collecting, who can access it, and who will effectively access it before making any decision about where the data should live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Pryv.io, you can easily store data into a distributed environment to enable local (on- premise/per choice) Regulations Compliance, and even create installations that span the globe and co-locate the data with the users’ legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on a powerful distributed model, users are distributed among servers with no global bottleneck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each user account can be served by a different server, which can be located anywhere. The capabilities are set by the architectures in terms of bandwidth and storage. The architecture is designed according to the client’s needs.</span></p>
<h4><b>(4) Data Sharing: </b><b>Dynamic Consent and Protected Access.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A clear sharing mechanism allows giving access to selected pieces of data to anyone, while still retaining full control over the data. Pryv.io enables you to define accesses with different levels of permissions for third-parties to interact with your data, or only particular folders of your data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through a sleek “campaign manager”, it manages access permissions of multiple accounts, making storing accesses of multiple data subjects that gave you their consent easier. The perfect solution to be able to retrieve all data accesses and facilitate data aggregation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about Pryv Consent Aggregation on our dedicated </span><a href="https://pryv.github.io/guides/data-modelling/#consent-aggregation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">web page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h4><b>(5) Data Audit: </b><b>Transparency at a glance.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io provides access to audit logs and pre-built compliance services. The Audit logs keep track of details about the actions performed by clients against Pryv.io accounts through the Pryv.io API. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A full audit trail documenting interaction with the data is embedded in the solution: who does create the data-point, when and under what granularity a consent is given. A proof that any access is authorized is provided  by listing all the processes applicable under GDPR, such as: who did access and review the data and when.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io facilitates compliance with existing and future data protection and privacy regulations on a global scale.</span></p>
<h4><b>(6) Data Retrieval: </b><b>protected backups for your users.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io allows you to provide your users with the option to backup their data on their computer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, we developed a ”blue button” app, which will allow the data to be exported as JSON files and packed inside a password protected zip in one click.</span></p>
<h4><b>(7) Data Deletion: </b><b>Data erasure on demand &#8211; proven and safe.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest issues with the data collection is that very rarely it is made clear for how long the data will be stored before being deleted. Only a few businesses provide their users the option to use the “download” and “delete” buttons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io proposes a specific mode that enables isolation of per-user data in back-ups for deletion.</span></p>
<p><b>Pryv.io Lifecycle Data Management Platform allows you to manage your data, rightly. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While your core business revolves around data collection, ours revolves around you. We thus made sure that our platform not only offers you a successfully proved solution, but also addresses all your concerns:</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard Business Review </span></i><a href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">called</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “data scientist the sexiest job of the 21st century”. Unlocking data value inspires you to look forward to finding out more. Dissecting data is what makes your business services worth; allowing you to bring value to your customers and to stay competitive. The more you collect, the better. But is it really about data collection?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flip the coin and you’ll see that the true potential of the data that you collect lies in its aggregation. Your data scientists will only be able to unlock its value when identifying rich data sources, aggregating them with others, and pooling large quantities of formless data.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Pryv.io, we enable you to pool and analyze data meaningfully.</span></p>
<h3><b>Data pooling enables you to combine data sets coming from different sources. </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let your Data Scientists Deep Dive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">data scientists need data. A lot of it. They can only make discoveries while swimming in deep data pools. Let them deep-dive &#8211; ensure that their swimming pool is deep enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to do so?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s assume that you aim at developing a Digital Health platform, fed with aggregated personal data. So data pooling means that you can:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">combine together data on one individual coming from multiple sources such as medical devices, specialist clinics, health records.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">merge into one file multiple datasets from many patients coming from various countries or institutions. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both cases, this is what makes the data pool deeper and generates value for your data scientists. </span></p>
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6415" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling-600x450.png" alt="Data Pooling By Pryv" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling-600x450.png 600w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling-768x576.png 768w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling.png 1912w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wait is over: the icing on the cake.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you know why data pooling is indispensable to get valuable insight from data that you collect. </span><b>Unlock your business value by ensuring that your data scientists are provided with enough data at a glance.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best is yet to come- the Icing on the cake : Pryv.io does it for you. From data collection to data aggregation, data structure and understanding, Pryv enables you to get the most out of the data you collect. Let’s walk through an example to illustrate where Pryv.io stands and how we can help you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s often that you are collecting data from different sources and that you need to share the whole or only part of the aggregated dataset with various third parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let’s go through a basic use case, in which you are conducting a clinical trial involving hundreds of patients from different institutions. You are researching the impact of allergen exposure and nutrition diet on the sleep behavior of patients, and you’re having three different teams analyzing the collected data from different perspectives :</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team A needs to analyze personal information from every patient (such as age, gender, ethnicity, etc);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team B is combining allergen exposure with sleep data to identify patterns;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team C is looking at the relationship between nutrition and sleep.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already getting a headache just thinking about how to structure your data efficiently to aggregate it and share only what each of the teams need?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io enables you to aggregate data from multiple sources and to share only what is needed.</span></p>
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6417" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/teams-600x444.png" alt="Data Pooling By Pryv" width="600" height="444" srcset="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/teams-600x444.png 600w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/teams-1024x758.png 1024w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/teams-768x569.png 768w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/teams-1536x1138.png 1536w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/teams.png 1912w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />
<h3><b>Pryv.io has developed a tool that solves it all for you. Our aggregator allows you to pool data from multiple sources at once, and to create appropriate and up-to-date datasets with data across multiple accounts for each team to work on.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How is that?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io aggregator enables you to collect and aggregate any type of data from all your patients. Data from a smartphone, a smartwatch, a health record, any source of data, all in one place.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our data model in “streams” and “events” structures your data, and allows your patients to grant your app/or your team access to the needed streams. (</span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/12/pryv-helps-you-collect-personal-data-rightfully/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more on that in this article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each patient’s data subset gets aggregated into your own database and the appropriate datasets are exposed to your teams and your algorithms/apps.</span></li>
</ul>
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6416" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/multiple_devices-600x445.png" alt="Data Pooling By Pryv" width="600" height="445" srcset="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/multiple_devices-600x445.png 600w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/multiple_devices-1024x760.png 1024w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/multiple_devices-768x570.png 768w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/multiple_devices-1536x1140.png 1536w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/multiple_devices.png 1908w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />

<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once datasets are allocated to each team by sharing the appropriate subsets of streams, they get automatically updated. It means that as soon as new data from any patient is collected, a webhook notifies the server that fetches the data and updates the dataset for the concerned team (more on webhooks in Pryv.io </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/2020/01/27/webhooks-at-pryv-io-when-data-ages-in-milliseconds-waiting-is-not-an-option/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6414" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling_loop-600x448.png" alt="Data Pooling By Pryv" width="600" height="448" srcset="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling_loop-600x448.png 600w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling_loop-1024x764.png 1024w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling_loop-768x573.png 768w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling_loop-1536x1146.png 1536w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_pooling_loop.png 1916w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All at once, you can now collect and aggregate data coming from different sources for one to thousands of patients, and create multiple data pools </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">so that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">your data scientists </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can work more efficiently and get the most out of your collected data</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All of that while respecting the data privacy of your patients, and ensuring a trusting relationship.</span></p>
<p><strong>It’s as simple as that, so you have one less thing to worry about and one more to benefit from: <a href="https://www.pryv.com">Pryv.io</a>.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing vast amounts of personal data has become “the new normal”, many would think. Wrong! Regulations race to implement adequate measures to protect personal data. Proving compliance is an increasingly pressing topic for any IT development team of a mobile (app) solution, based on personal data aggregation. Privacy-compliance is the new normal. Developing an effective privacy-preserving data management solution is imperative. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will show you the power of using Pryv.io data-audit to de-risk your compliance. </span></i></p>
<h2><b>So what are audit logs?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audit logs maintain a full and complete history of every change that has been made on a piece of data, by whom and when. An audit log is the simplest, yet also one of the most effective forms of tracking temporal information. Any time something significant happens, a record indicating what happened and when it happened, is generated.</span></p>
<h2><b>What do data audits look like? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can take many physical forms, but the most common form is a file. It must contain all relevant information concerning the sequence of activities that affected at any time a specific operation, procedure, or event in an IT system. In addition to documenting what resources were accessed, audit log entries usually include destination and source addresses, a timestamp and user login information.</span></p>
<h2><b>Why do you need to use data-audits? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stringent data protection regulations become a major concern to organizations. Bolstering your data management capabilities to meet compliance is a priority and business-critical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond being a good practice, using data-audits will not only allow you to keep logs of any data interactions but also to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“demonstrate compliance</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, which is a key point of the GDPR.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, audit logs have taken on new importance for cybersecurity and are often the basis for diagnostic performance, error correction and security analysis.</span></p>
<h2><b>De-risk your compliance with data-audit at Pryv.io</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audit logs keep track of details about the actions performed by your app users against Pryv.io accounts through the Pryv.io API. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, it describes the source (the identifier for the action that generated this log), the type of log, the time when it was executed, the audited action (typically the API method call), the identifier for the access used to perform the audited action, and the HTTP response status resulting from the audited action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is an example of a single audit log in Pryv.io : </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-6378" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-04-at-10.16.17-600x274.png" alt="Audit logs Pryv" width="485" height="221" srcset="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-04-at-10.16.17-600x274.png 600w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-04-at-10.16.17-768x351.png 768w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-04-at-10.16.17.png 788w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can see that the IP address “172.18.0.7” was used to get the events from the stream “Diary” at the time 1261988300 seconds, and that the attempt was unsuccessful as the used access has expired, all of this at one glance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audit logging is an essential ingredient for your infrastructure. By using the capabilities of Pryv.io log management system, you are a step closer in succeeding your compliance auditing. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Another year yet we still hear and read about this same new year’s business resolution.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">“2020: Make trust first priority…”</h4>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">So what? Enough with words, actions need to be taken.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>The loss of trust.</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Today, if you’re in the business of collecting sensitive personal data, building trust with your customers is essential for growing your business.</p>
<p>For many years now, users have been misguided and left in the dark regarding the processing of their own personal data. As a result, they tend to be more reluctant when it comes to sharing confidential information.</p>
<p>It’s simple: if your customers don’t trust you, they won’t provide you with their most sensitive data – and that is especially true in the healthcare sector.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Trust needs restoring.</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Privacy and data protection regulations are trying to compensate for that fact, but the truth is: most companies still fail at implementing great consent solutions to keep data collection secure.</p>
<p>Yet, consent is most certainly your best opportunity for restoring that trust, dear business owners. Instead of approaching consent with fear and restraint, you should embrace the opportunity to win new customers and engage better with your existing ones!</p>
<p>But, first thing first: does your customer trust you? Truly?</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Enhancing trust requires rethinking consent.</b></p></blockquote>
<p>From a business perspective, “consent” is a legal requirement that a company should get in order to collect, use and further profit from their customers’ data.</p>
<p>Certainly, this way of thinking is precisely why most companies fail at implementing consent: they use it as a way of protecting themselves instead of taking it as an opportunity to build a trusting relationship with their customers.</p>
<p>So what is the key to rethinking consent?</p>
<p>If the “customer is King” for business, “Consent is King” for trust.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Consent is not about you.</b></p></blockquote>
<p>From a customer-perspective, consent is their right to fully understand and choose how you would actually use and collect their data. So don’t make it all about you.</p>
<p>Rightfully ask for consent and don’t let the prospect of a quick profit blind you. Chances are: you’ll get a lot more out of a lasting relationship.</p>
<p>Moreover, consent should be easy to give or revoke any given time. And when it comes to sensitive personal data (like health-related data), it should always be explicit.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>It should be “freely given”.</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Be straightforward and simple when requesting access to data. Even if you are tempted to get more data by using gamification strategies, be careful. While it is one thing to motivate your customers through games and a user-friendly interface, it’s another to get consent over addiction.</p>
<p>Simply explain how you will turn the shared data into meaningful insightful feedback to your customers. And don’t use dark patterns like rewards and punishment to discourage your customers from exercising their rights to privacy.</p>
<p>Instead, why not use these same techniques to get a “specific, informed and unambiguous” consent?</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Dynamic consent.</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Dynamic consent is a new approach to consent that allows companies to put data users back at the center of the decision making process.</p>
<p>More specifically, it is a personalized digital interface that enables two-way communication between data users and data collectors, thus allowing for customers to give or revoke consent at any step of the way.</p>
<p>Generally, it is that part that companies fear the most: the risk of having users withdrawing their consent which will lead to less available data to be processed.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Turning risks into opportunities!</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, there is a risk to allow your customers to revoke consent.</p>
<p>But there is also a risk not to! From GDPR fines to having customers quitting your application due to the lack of flexibility, risks of losing money and data are pretty much everywhere and are no justification for bad practices and unrightful solutions.</p>
<p>Also, with each risk comes an equal opportunity! In that case: building a strong, compliant growing business. What is to fear about that?</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Additional benefits.</b></p></blockquote>
<p>New customers, further engagement from existing ones, relevant insights based on consent choices, a proof-regulation, compliant business, a lawful, ethical and challenging work environment… There are many ways in which you can actually benefit from properly implementing and managing consent, but only if you choose to!</p>
<p>Just remember that building trust and empowering your customers with transparency and choice will not only benefit them, but also you and your company in the long run.</p>
<p>Additionally, consider that not managing consent properly also has its drawbacks.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>2020: Trust in consent-power to strengthen your business!</b></p></blockquote>
<p>While most companies often think only about “lost profits”: <i>How much will I lose if they revoke consent? Would they have consented if they didn’t know?… </i>be the one to win profits!</p>
<p>If you haven’t ever considered how much you could actually gain from properly implementing and managing consent, after reading this article, we hope that you will.</p>
<p>Wishing you all the best and success for 2020, Stephanie &amp; Evelina.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Managing Personal Data Rightfully from The First Time and Overtime</strong></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, collecting personal data is made easy, many would say. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">While collecting data can be easy, getting valuable insights from it is certainly not. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more, managing it properly so that you win your users&#8217; trust and stay on top of the regulations is the hard job to do.</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if you could spend less time worrying about how to manage personal data?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if you could use this time to increase your users’ trust and engagement?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if you could focus on your own benefits and return on your data investments?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Pryv.io, we enable you to manage personal data rightfully &#8211; from the first time and overtime.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter the existing and upcoming regulations on data protection, our software allows you to remain compliant at all times and to build a trustful relationship with your users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how does it work? Let’s walk through a basic use case to see how Pryv.io solves data privacy challenges.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collecting personal data in real-time allows you to gain valuable insights quickly and to make decisions accordingly. </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s say that you have built an algorithm that computes allergen exposure based on geolocation data and displays it on your app to users and their doctors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This involves three types of actors : </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your app users;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your algorithm, that processes the geolocation data of the users and computes the allergen exposure;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctors, who consult the allergen exposure data and provide feedback to the app users.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your algorithm takes the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">personal geolocation data, processes it, outputs the allergen exposure and shares it with the user (patient) and doctors on the digital app at any time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy? Well, sounds easy enough to collect personal data until you need to prove that you have the right to collect it and handle data privacy correctly.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The geolocation of your user is a personal, sensitive data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your user has the right to revoke his consent and to decline sharing this sensitive data with any other third-parties (such as doctors, in this use case). </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, your user really wants to use your app to help him and to be guided by his doctor about his allergen exposure. Is this possible? We made a simple way to do it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6399" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/allergens_use_case-600x452.png" alt="" width="600" height="452" srcset="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/allergens_use_case-600x452.png 600w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/allergens_use_case-1024x772.png 1024w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/allergens_use_case-768x579.png 768w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/allergens_use_case-1536x1158.png 1536w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/allergens_use_case.png 1658w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensitive Personal Data Sharing, Simplified.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only the algorithm needs to see the geolocation data, and nobody else, so why not just restrain the read access of the geolocation data to the algorithm?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And restrain the allergens data to the user and his doctor?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And oh, what if his doctor wants to communicate his feedback to the user?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starts to get a bit more complex, mmh ?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s draw it simply in “streams” and display the data using </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/data_in_pryv/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv Data Model</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> :</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6401" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_model_structure-600x453.png" alt="Pryv Data Model Allergens" width="600" height="453" srcset="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_model_structure-600x453.png 600w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_model_structure-1024x774.png 1024w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_model_structure-768x580.png 768w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_model_structure-1536x1160.png 1536w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/data_model_structure.png 1652w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When structuring the data in “streams” (which act like folders on your computer), you will be adding “events”, corresponding to time-stamped data in the related stream, and managing the level of “access” to this stream (‘read’, ‘manage’, ‘contribute’ or ‘create-only’).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the stream “Position” will only contain events of type “position/wgs84”, whereas the stream “Allergens” will contain substreams of allergens (“Pollen”, “Cereal crops”, etc) with events of type &#8220;density/kg-m3&#8221; …</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you see how our data model in streams and events is helpful. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has never been that easy to take and share only a piece of data, with different levels of access.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For your app, it means that: first, the data is collected, aggregated from different sources and structured in the right way in Pryv.io. Then, it enables your app users to decide </span><b>what</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they want to share and </span><b>with whom, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and to revoke that access at any time</span><b>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And finally, it gives you peace of mind for any data privacy regulations, as all the requirements to meet are already designed in Pryv.io. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an app user, you decide if you :</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">want the algorithm only to be able to see your geolocation? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share the stream “Position” with a “read” level.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">want your doctor to see your allergen exposure? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share the stream “Allergens” with a “read” level.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">want your doctor to give you feedback and advice? Share the stream “Doctor’s feedback” with a “manage” level, enabling the doctor to add his comments in newly created child streams of this stream.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can be all automated by creating access requests from your app. It will send a notification to your user to request access to the stream  “Position” stream on a “read” level and to “Allergens” on a “manage” level.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-6405 aligncenter" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-04-at-13.47.53.png" alt="Pryv example Data Allergens" width="199" height="316" /></span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a Trustful Relationship with Your Users, made easy.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By structuring the data you collect in this way and sharing the data of your user at a very granular level only to authorized third-parties with the user’s explicit consent, you establish a trustful relationship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more trust your users have in your app, the more data they will share.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the data your users are willing to share, you will be able to adapt the user interfaces to the different third-parties and display only authorized data.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6402" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/doctor_interface-600x420.png" alt="Data Aggregation Alergens" width="600" height="420" srcset="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/doctor_interface-600x420.png 600w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/doctor_interface-1024x717.png 1024w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/doctor_interface-768x537.png 768w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/doctor_interface.png 1386w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6403" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/patient_interface-600x451.png" alt="Allergens Example Data Aggregation Pryv" width="600" height="451" srcset="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/patient_interface-600x451.png 600w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/patient_interface-1024x770.png 1024w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/patient_interface-768x577.png 768w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/patient_interface.png 1338w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respecting your user’s privacy will make your users more prone to share personal information with you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the more data you will get, the more you will be able to provide valuable insights for your customer.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Pryv.io notifies your app of any data changes from now.</strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast world, fast life- technology made the world change in milliseconds. Every second, a new piece of personal information is born. It begins its long journey in this digital world from being created, updated, acknowledged &#8230; leaving digital footprints with the purpose to be transferred into valuable insight to someone. Regulators made it clear, as owners of these pieces of information, each individual (user) can execute his rights to demand their full traceability at any given time.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait a second?!? Sometimes even a delay of several microseconds is not acceptable.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p><b><i>For the app developers of personal-data fed solutions, delivering</i></b><b><i> on this is </i></b><b><i>challenging.</i></b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we provide you with worth-to-know insights on how Pryv.io notifies your app of any data changes from now; what are webhooks, why you’d better use them and how to integrate webhooks into your infrastructure with Pryv.io.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<h1><b>The wait is over : webhooks update data before you know it</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If transfer of information is happening in real-time, users expect to get updates on what is being done in the blink of an eye. </span><b>Having to wait until your app or your server goes to check on its own if something new happened with the data you are collecting is not acceptable anymore.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, this is exactly why webhooks have been created; and this is also the reason why we decided to implement them on Pryv.io. When you require real-time notifications of events, using a webhook is really your best option.</span></p>
<h3><b>What exactly are Webhooks?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By definition, webhooks are a way to set up a push notification to a predefined URL endpoint. It is triggered by some event that one wishes to be alerted of, mostly in order to act on it. These are automated messages sent from web services when something happens.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s how PayPal tells user’s accounting app when their clients pay them, how MailChimp notifies their users of common events such as subscribing, unsubscribing and profile changes, how Shopify keeps some parts of their users’ commerce and fulfilment system up-to-date&#8230;and how Pryv.io notifies your app of any data changes from now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put it simply, webhooks act much like push notifications. Each time when a data change occurs in the account of your app users, your web service gets notified. Let’s say for example a new event related to their physical activity. As soon as the new event has been created, your web service gets a message like “Hey, something new just happened on one of the accounts !”. A data change has occurred in your users’ data, and your web service got notified about it. You can now process the fresh and up-to-date data with your algorithms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Webhooks work the same way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point of contact between your server and the webhook is the URL that was provided at the creation of the webhook. You get notified of data changes in a web service using webhooks, that send an HTTP POST request to this URL </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with a payload similar to the notification message below :</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-6360 aligncenter" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/payload.png" alt="" width="427" height="180"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The server which listens to the provided URL receives the request and only needs to retrieve events and streams since last change to see what’s new. Nothing left to be done.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Why use webhooks?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having up-to-date data is crucial for your process or your algorithms to work properly. You need to have reliable information to be able to keep your algorithm at pace with data changes happening in a few seconds.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you don’t want to have to go manually knock on the door and check whether you have some fresh information on your user’s data account, do you ? What you want, and what you actually need, is the information to come to you automatically and tell you : “There is something new waiting for you, just come and have a look.”.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation leads to optimization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still not convinced ? Here is a concrete use case that can fit the service you are offering with your digital app, your clinical trial or any research you are performing with personal data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s say that your service integrates health or personal data using your Pryv.io platform, and you’d like to allow your app users to share their data with doctors or any other third parties, and to maintain the aggregated dataset up-to-date.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can easily do it now. Thanks to webhooks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How ? The user first consents to give access to the doctor or any other third party to his data. Each time he records new data with your app, the data is added and stored on the dedicated Pryv.io platform. The webhook notifies the web service whenever a data change occurs, which automatically maintains the dataset up-to-date.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The doctor can then retrieve the latest data of any user and consult the updated aggregated dataset whenever he needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user can revoke his consent at any time, which notifies the web service through webhooks and removes his data from the data record.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As simple as that !</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6362" src="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/webhooks-600x450.png" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/webhooks-600x450.png 600w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/webhooks-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/webhooks-768x576.png 768w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/webhooks-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/webhooks-2048x1537.png 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few weeks ago at the Web Summit, we heard a sentence that got stuck in our minds. </span></i></p>
<p><b><i>“GDPR displaces the problem. The problem is not data protection, but data collection” </i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; said Edward Snowden </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We code and we are passionate about developing privacy-preserving software. So this statement got us thinking: isn’t the real problem actually that developers don’t know much about the legal requirements that come with the development of their applications? </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we would like to provide you with a way of development thinking that could help you overcome this challenge, or at least offer you a gift from Pryv: a little roadmap to privacy-compliance (or the 10 facts you should know when developing personal data collecting apps).</span></i></p>

<p><b>A little roadmap to privacy</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we acknowledge the need to restrain abusive data collection practices, we also believe that, with the right knowledge and intent, the collection and processing of personal data can actually help a lot. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, we’ve decided to gather and further explain some facts about data, privacy, GDPR and compliance that (we hope) will help and guide you when confronted with the collection of personal data. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like a roadmap brings you straightforward where you want to be.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here are the 10 facts that we think you should know &#8211; or some tips that could help you achieve privacy:</span></p>
<p><b>#1. Different kinds of data </b><b><i>need different kinds of attention.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law distinguishes sensitive data from personal data. And did you know that personal data that are sensitive data in regard to the law requires specific protection?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, collecting health-related data will require you to be more cautious about consent and security than collecting the language personal preference of your customers. </span></p>
<p><b>Tip:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Always be aware of the kind of data you aim at collecting and using- today, tomorrow and in the further development of your project: so you can build your data infrastructure right from day 1. </span></p>
<p><b>#2. Data minimisation </b><b><i>is a thing.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that the law also requires you to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">only</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> collect and process data that are actually needed for the purpose of your application? GDPR calls it “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">data minimisation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. And it applies to any personal data collecting app. To yours, too. If you doubt it, let’s check it out together. </span></p>
<p><b>Tip:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With that in mind, you should then always have a strict purpose for your application, and define the data that are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">strictly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> necessary to achieve that purpose. Don’t worry if you cannot project from now your future data needs, we prepared you another “tip” for this below.</span></p>
<p><b>#3. Metadata</b><b><i> matters.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And more importantly, they can give way more information than you think. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, by consenting to give you their geolocation data, your customers could certainly provide you with more information on their daily habits than they do with their actual logs about it.</span></p>
<p><b>Tip</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Make sure that your customers are always aware of what data you collect and what you are doing with their data, who can access it, and for what purpose. Be clear and transparent.</span></p>
<p><b>#4. GDPR key concepts </b><b><i>are a good start… </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right of access. The right to rectification. The right to be forgotten. The right to restriction of processing. The right to data portability. The right to object&#8230;</span></p>
<p><b>Tip:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If your application falls under GDPR, these are the rights (or at least some of) that you should be able to provide to your customers. So make sure you take that under consideration when building your data model.</span></p>
<p><b>#5…but Privacy-by-design is the thing!! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR is a good start if you’re looking for general guidelines to achieve privacy: by having these key concepts in mind, you will more likely tend towards a Privacy-by-design approach, and will thus likely make your code also more “regulation-proof”.</span></p>
<p><b>Tip: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy isn&#8217;t only about compliance. It is also about transparency, and building trusted relationships with the users of your application. And as outlined in our previous article, using a privacy-by-design approach will probably save you a lot of trouble in the long run!</span></p>
<p><b><i>#6. </i></b><b>Consent</b><b><i> is (not) an issue.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consent is any “freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, unless explicitly agreed for a concrete period of time, the consent must be easy to give and revoke at any given time.</span></p>
<p><b>Tip:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You should always keep in mind that consent isn’t given by default. And your customers shouldn’t be asked to implicitly consent with your architecture either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, have you ever heard of dynamic consent? If not, better get to know about it, as it will give you the flexibility and scalability you are looking for.</span></p>
<p><b>#7. Scalability </b><b><i>meets compliance.</i></b><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, you prepare your code to be GDPR-compliant. Tomorrow, the ePrivacy Regulation will ask you additional layers of protection and code adaptation. And for what you know, your app could also soon be categorized as a medical device under the new Medical Device Regulation, or it could just be the market itself that suddenly requires you to adapt your software accordingly. </span></p>
<p><b>Tip:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ensure scalability across legal frameworks. Not only with regard to existing and forthcoming regulations, but beyond. Regulations come and change, scalability is by-design.</span></p>
<p><b>#8. Proven compliance </b><b><i>is a must-have</i></b><b>.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, documentation is boring&#8230;(we know right?!), but required. We bet that you tend to postpone this part. The truth, however, is that within the context of managing personal data, your code will be audited. You will have to prove that you collect consent properly, store and share the data compliantly, aggregate and analyse on-purpose, and that you can validate that the data has been deleted, whenever the will for this is given.</span></p>
<p><b>Tip:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Play smart, not hard! Evaluate a ready-to-use privacy-by-design solution, which is already documented, so you can free yourself from the hard work of documenting your code. We heard our customers say that they really appreciate us having this for them.(</span><a href="http://pryv.github.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">check it out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OR:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Document your decisions and development processes to prove that you know what you do and how.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Document your code to make it audit-able.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Document how you collect the data and for what purpose </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Document each time a process access data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Document each time data is erased.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that some of this documentation should be generated by your digital solution itself.</span></p>
<p><b>#9. Data breaches </b><b><i>happen</i></b><b>. </b><b><br />
</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But only to others, right?! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> As developers, it is always tempting to go to « the cool stuff » and then unconsciously skip some very important steps. </span></p>
<p><b>Tip:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mind-shift. By having in mind that a breach could happen to you, you will take more precaution and arm yourself (and your software) to handle the crisis. So take this risk seriously and don’t forget about security. </span></p>
<p><b>#10 (&#8230;.)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We listen. Carefully. So if </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are a developer of a personal data-based app, what do you think would be the 10th fact to consider, so we can make this « cheat-sheet » excellent?</span></p>
<p><b>Now it’s all about you.</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">At <a href="https://www.pryv.com/">Pryv</a>, we aim at empowering companies and developers so that they can rapidly create and scale breakthrough, GDPR compliant products, and know what to keep in mind when developing personal data collecting apps. So we hope this article will help carry out our mission.</span></i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The importance of maintaining patient confidentiality in a connected healthcare ecosystem often results in de-correlating the personal identity &#8211; which is still the preferred way to achieve compliance for care providers and research teams. However, keeping a privacy-ensured direct communication channel between the patient and the researcher or the health professional is required for a number of remote monitoring solutions. <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Medisanté and Pryv join forces to combine the best of both worlds, thus making Remote Patient Monitoring simple and scalable while ensuring GDPR compliance out-of-the-box.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-6161"></span></p>
<p><em>Lausanne/Lucerne, Switzerland, March 19th, 2020</em> – The Swiss leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, Pryv SA, and Medisanté Group AG, the world&#8217;s leading provider of direct-to-cloud medical IoT infrastructure, announced a strategic collaboration.</p>
<p>A simple and secure solution for remote monitoring of patients at home is ready to be implemented by any home-care service and healthcare facility, globally. The platform addresses the imperatives across the continuum of care: focusing on delivering seamless user experience, reliable health-metrics, and establishing a patient-to-care team relationship, without compromising on data privacy and digital ethics.</p>
<blockquote><p><em> ”Today, more than ever, remote access to care is nothing less than an indispensable service. We are thrilled to be able to work with Medisant</em>é<em> products, which have been proven in delivering the unbeatable strength of accessibility, connectivity, and usability.&#8221; says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv. &#8220;Leveraging on Medisant</em>é’s<em> zero-touch medical IoT infrastructure, we are determined to ushering remote patient monitoring and telecare where it is needed the most, to anyone, at any time”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Strengthening the adoption of innovative digital health solutions relies on two main pillars: usability and trust. The personal patient data is critical and highly sensitive- thus, undoubtedly, security and privacy are at the core of designing reliable medical-grade digital solutions. GDPR, MDR, national-specific regulations and reimbursement plans set up high entry barriers for medical IoT and digital healthcare providers, leaving them no choice but to comply. The regulations make it clear: « consent should be explicitly and freely given». Moreover, any system provider should be able to offer an opt-out option at any given time.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Our strategic partnership with Pryv offers a major added value to care organizations and CROs using our solution for Remote Patient Monitoring, as it allows them to guarantee data privacy. It also gives them top-grade tools to manage explicit consent to share patient data with the various stakeholders, such as health insurances in countries where reimbursement of RPM is dependent of a minimal number of measurements performed by the patient each month.” – Gilles Lunzenfichter, CEO and Co-founder of Medisanté</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Harnessing the power of medical IoT devices allows keeping track of patients’ health outside of the healthcare premises, drastically decreasing costs, optimizing resources and most importantly significantly improving the well-being and comfort of patients.</p>
<p>Facilitating the care teams’ daily operations while scaling up telemonitoring to millions of chronic and elderly patients is a reality now. Not tomorrow, but today. Book a demo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrairement à ce que des entreprises peuvent croire, la Certification HDS de leur hébergeur n’implique en aucun cas leur conformité au RGPD. Tout ce que cela leur indique, c’est que leur hébergeur offre des garanties suffisantes en matière de protection des données.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">La confusion vient du fait que, malgré tout, faire appel à un sous-traitant certifié HDS pourra souvent aider le Responsable du traitement à se conformer au RGPD… Qu’en est-il donc ?</span></em></p>
<h2><b>La Certification HDS dans le contexte du RGPD</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selon le RGPD, une entreprise qui collecte et traite des données à caractère personnel doit remplir plusieurs exigences. Notamment :</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Définir les buts et finalités des données qu’elle collecte</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recueillir le consentement des utilisateurs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garantir les droits des utilisateurs (droit à l’oubli, droit à la portabilité, etc.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garantir la sécurité des données</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mettre en place une procédure en cas de fuites des données</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tenir un registre des activités de traitement des données (traçabilité des données)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cependant, il n’est pas exclu que cette entreprise fasse appel à des entreprises externes pour l’aider. Par exemple, une entreprise peut décider d’externaliser les données qu’elle collecte auprès d’un hébergeur sous-traitant, lui permettant ainsi de ne pas devoir elle-même implémenter une solution d’hébergement, ni de devoir en assurer la sécurité.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mais dans ce cas : comment s’assurer qu’un hébergeur offre des garanties suffisantes en matière de protection des données ? Comment s’assurer que les services qu’il propose sont sécurisés ? Et comment garantir que les droits de vos utilisateurs seront exercés ?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">En France, ce problème est résolu par la Certification HDS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selon l’art. L1111-8 CSP, toute entreprise qui héberge des données personnelles de santé pour le compte d’un tiers est soumise à l’obligation d’une Certification HDS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pour obtenir cette certification, l’hébergeur devra démontrer qu’il remplit plusieurs exigences.Notamment:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">les exigences de la norme ISO 20071 (sécurité des SI)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">une partie des exigences de la norme ISO 20000-1 (gestion des services)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">des exigences complémentaires aux normes précitées</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">des exigences relatives à la protection des données personnelles de santé</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(il est conseillé de se référer aux exigences de la norme ISO 27018)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">des exigences complémentaires pour la protection de ces données</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">des exigences spécifiques au domaine de la santé</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ainsi, toute entreprise qui fait appel aux services d’un hébergeur certifié aura la garantie que celui-ci offre des produits et/ou services suffisamment sécurisés (en vertu des normes ISO correspondantes), et qu’il respecte la confidentialité des données hébergées.</span></p>
<h2><b>Pourquoi les entreprises qui sous-traitent leurs données auprès d’un hébergeur certifié HDS doivent-elles encore se conformer au GDPR ?</b></h2>
<h3><b>#1</b> <b>L’hébergeur n’est certifié HDS que pour les services qu’il propose.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">La Certification HDS se décompose en six niveaux d’activité différents pour deux métiers d’hébergement distincts. On a donc :</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Un certificat </span><b>“hébergeur d’infrastructure physique” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">pour:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">La mise à disposition de sites physiques permettant d’héberger l’infrastructure matérielle du SI de santé (1)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">La mise à disposition de l’infrastructure matérielle du SI de santé (2)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Un certificat </span><b>“hébergeurs infogéreurs”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pour:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">La mise à disposition de la plateforme logicielle (OS, middleware, base de données) du SI de santé (3)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">La mise à disposition de l’infrastructure virtuelle du SI de santé (4)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">L’administration et l’exploitation du SI de données (5)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">La sauvegarde externalisée des données de santé (6)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Un hébergeur n’est certifié que pour les services qu’il propose ; il ne répond donc que des exigences liées à ses activités. Les entreprises doivent donc vérifier ce pour quoi leurs hébergeurs sont certifiés, et être au clair sur les services qui leur sont fournis.</span></p>
<h3><b>#2</b> <b>C’est l’hébergeur qui est certifié HDS, non pas l’entreprise qui utilise ses services.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Même si une entreprise fait appel à un hébergeur certifié HDS pour les données qu’elle collecte, cela ne dit rien sur sa propre conformité au regard du RGPD.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">L’un des scénarios les plus courants est celui du “Shadow IT”. Une entreprise peut utiliser le système sécurisé d’un hébergeur pour ses données, mais si ses employés en gardent une copie sur des systèmes non sécurisés, alors ces données ne seront pas protégées.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">L’entreprise doit donc toujours vérifier qu’elle remplit</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> elle-même</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> toutes les exigences du RGPD, même si son hébergeur en remplit certaines </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">de son côté</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. De plus, il faut garder à l’esprit que l’externalisation des données repose sur un modèle de </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fr/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">responsabilité partagée</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><b>#3</b> <b>La Certification HDS ne couvre pas toutes les exigences du RGPD.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enfin, il faut savoir que les exigences de la Certification HDS ne couvrent pas </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/certification-hds-et-rgpd-une-analyse-comparative-francois-kaag"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">toutes</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> les exigences du RGPD. Dès lors, même si une entreprise décidait de remplir elle-même toutes les exigences de la certification, elle ne serait toujours pas conforme au RGPD.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ainsi, même en faisant appel à un hébergeur certifié HDS pour les 6 niveaux d&#8217;activité, une entreprise devra toujours veiller à se conformer </span><b><i>elle-même, entièrement</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> au RGPD.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Un hébergeur certifié HDS offre simplement des solutions fiables sur lesquelles les entreprises peuvent s’appuyer pour atteindre leur propre conformité.</span></p>
<h3><b>Pourquoi la Certification HDS peut néanmoins </b><b>aider les entreprises à se conformer au RGPD en interne ?</b></h3>
<h4><b>La Certification HDS peut servir de guide pour les entreprises</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Le RGPD ne donne que les lignes directrices à suivre pour les entreprises. Par exemple, l’art. 32 RGPD impose aux entreprises d’assurer la sécurité des données, mais ne dit rien sur la façon dont cette sécurité doit être implémentée.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">S’appuyer sur les exigences de la Certification HDS peut donc les aider à se conformer au RGPD. Néanmoins, les entreprises restent tenues de se conformer à toutes les exigences qui ne sont pas couvertes par la Certification HDS.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Lausanne/Bern, Switzerland, October 29<sup>th</sup>,  2019 – </strong>The Swiss leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, Pryv, was selected by the family practice Huttwil GmbH to enhance the patient-doctor communication of its intelligent booking tool, umana, by providing advanced privacy-preserving capabilities. Scheduled to launch in Q1 of 2020, the eHealth solution allows patients to send relevant data directly to their doctor while scheduling an appointment. Patients can book appointments and complete online evidence-based health check-ups in the app. For doctors, umana can help manage their agenda, set online appointments and perform check-ups. Through all this, Pryv ensures that the patient-doctor relationship is built on a foundation of trust by integrating comprehensive consent management and secure data management capabilities.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Dr. Damian Meli, Project lead at umana,</em></strong><em> said: “This partnership represents a further step in umana’s journey to building the most user-centric patient-doctor communication tool to be integrated with the Swiss Electronic Health Record system. Comprehensive data protection and compliance with data management regulations are essential to our development. We chose Pryv because they share our belief that the confidentiality and privacy of our users is a top priority. The integration of the pryv.io software is designed to meet the increasing demands from patients and regulating authorities for more transparent and trustworthy methods for the management of personal data.”</em></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong><em>Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO and co-founder of Pryv SA</em></strong><em>, said: “We are proud to have been chosen by umana. It shows that they are committed to the increasing value of digitized content in healthcare. By working with some of the world’s eHealth pioneers, like umana, Pyrv can accumulate reliable industry experience which we can deploy in our development and agile operating model. Not only has umana demonstrated that they value each patient, but they are also interested in building a relationship based on trust with them, which will surely foster more efficient digital communication between patients and healthcare providers.”   </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Pryv’s privacy-by-design approach promotes privacy and data protection compliance to guide patients’ data security decisions throughout their experience with a tool such as umana. As healthcare organizations increasingly integrate personal data into their services and processes, they continuously encounter the challenges of compliance and the chances of a breach of private data. Unfortunately, the defense mechanisms are often added on to existing structures as an after-thought, or in some cases, ignored altogether despite the fact that they should be embedded into the foundation of the system.</p>
<p>As an eHealth platform, umana aims to connect service providers, such as doctors or pharmacists, with their patients. The solution will allow for appointment booking, direct messaging, medication plans and, in the future, Swiss EPD – all regulated via one access point. For patients, umana will allow them to book appointments and share vital parameters and personal information with doctors through web and smartphone applications. Thanks to Pryv, this transparent exchange of private information will be compliant with GDPR and Swiss DPA regulations.</p>
<p><strong>About umana</strong></p>
<p>umana is a new Swiss health platform that offers products and services for patients and doctors. As an international team of family doctors and engineers, we have used our expertise and creativity to reduce and optimize the wait time before a patient meets with their healthcare provider. The booking tool can be easily integrated into any practice and makes consultations more streamlined and more pleasant for patients. At umana, we harness the power of digitalization to create comprehensive, relevant and personalized health services.</p>

<p><strong>About Pryv</strong></p>

We help organizations manage personal data from creation through use and sharing, as well as address the enhanced data subject rights under GDPR such as transparency, portability and right-to-be-forgotten.  Our solution, pryv.io is an extensible personal data lifecycle management platform specifically engineered to empower developers to rapidly create and scale breakthrough GDPR and HIPAA compliant products, services and experiences. The software has been developed to accommodate rapid integration. It comes with turnkey IoT connectivity, a secure storage vault, fine-grained consent management and comprehensive auditing capability that radically cut IT development costs and accelerate time-to-benefit while addressing the most stringent data protection requirements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The innovative RWD eConsent solution is ideal for enhancing clinical trials with Real-World Data (RWD), achieving privacy compliance and improving patients’ engagement.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switzerland, Morges, 12 June 2019 – </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv, the leading Swiss provider of privacy and personal data management software, and BGO Software, a Bulgaria-based leading software services and product development company, have announced the launch of an innovative eCRF solution to manage Real-World Data (RWD) and informed electronic consent (eConsent).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designed to meet the requirements of GDPR and HIPAA regulations, the eCRF solution is based on <a href="https://www.pryv.com/#solutions">Pryv.io middleware</a> and BGO Software’s <a href="https://www.metaforms.org/">Metaforms software</a>. Among the key functionalities of the solution is its ability to dynamically capture and store patients’ informed eConsent. To ensure trust and compliance, a full audit trail documenting interaction with the data is embedded in the solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The web-based form-building software allows </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">researchers and clinicians </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to capture patients’ RWD and pave the way to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">useable insights</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> . </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This data includes information from complex forms, questionnaires, voice input, wearable devices, mobile health (mHealth) apps, electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePRO), environment and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RWD is considered to be a major source of valuable information from patients in real-world conditions. Capturing RWD improves personalized patient care and enables more efficient scientific and clinical research. Additionally, this data makes it possible to monitor a patient’s safety and evaluate risk, demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness, gain market access and address the public’s growing interest in an efficient and sustainable healthcare system.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i>“</i><i>Real-World Data is undoubtedly a valuable asset. However, creating and integrating dynamic forms and complying with regulations can be a very complex task and requires specific knowledge,” said Ivailo Ivanov, CTO of BGO Software. “Collaborating with Pryv adds an additional layer to the management of clinical data in our product Metaforms and ensures the patient’s data remains private. This is vital to ensuring they feel confident in sharing their data and giving us access to RWD.</i><i>”</i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the software architecture of an mHealth application is important to ensuring the successful implementation and usage of the solution, this is only one part. A user-friendly design is more than just aesthetics. It plays a crucial role in the patient’s engagement, the operational efficiency, and the overall management of clinical data.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i>“A regulatory-compliant eCRF solution is one of the most common requests we receive from customers,” said Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO of Pryv. “A user-friendly design is the key to collecting enriched RWD. By using BGO’s clinical data management experience and engineering know-how, we have been able to create an easy-to-use, modern and intuitive end-to-end solution that captures RWD and manages dynamic eConsent.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pryv/BGO eCRF RWD solution can be accessed anywhere and can be customized to fit the needs and processes of any business or organization. Its functionalities benefit multicenter clinical trials. An API for third-party integrations has been made available to optimize data collection and real-time sharing. The solution is easily adopted and can be quickly launched – a transition to a paperless process is possible within a few weeks and the solution can be deployed on site or over the cloud.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grâce aux données de santé, il est possible de déduire l’état de santé, aussi bien physique que mentale, d’un individu et ainsi lui apporter des soins plus personnalisés en accord avec le style de vie de la personne. Alors que la PDétait auparavant collectée par le médecin ou l’hôpital, la collecte se fait désormais via des appareils connectés ou des applications. « Exploitées et contextualisées, les données d’un bracelet connecté peuvent informer sur la condition physique d’une personne ou encore sur ses habitudes de vie. Avec les données GPS d’un individu, s’il sort régulièrement de son bureau dans la journée, on peut ainsi en déduire qu’il est fumeur, ce qui est important pendant une étude clinique » explique Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO de PRYV.</p>
<p>Au-delà d’être une simple contrainte légale, le RGPD, le Règlement général sur la protection des données, apporte un contexte à la donnée privée. « L’entreprise qui collecte des données personnelles doit désormais répondre à ces questions : quelles données avez-vous sur moi ? Ai-je consenti à vous les donner ? Si oui, quand ? Les avez-vous partagées et ai-je donné mon consentement pour ce partage ? Pourtant, loin d’être un frein, le RGPD met en place un cadre à la collecte de données à vocation médicale ». De la même façon qu’un compteur électrique intelligent peut analyser vos consommations et en déduire vos habitudes alimentaires (utilisation de plaques ou d’un micro-ondes par exemple), l’usage d’un store électrique peut informer sur le sommeil d’une personne.</p>
<p>Créée en 2012, Pryv, société indépendante qui œuvre dans le domaine de la santé numérique, développe un logiciel permettant de répondre aux besoins technologiques de la télémédecine et de la e-Santé, au cadre réglementaire du RGPD, ainsi qu’aux contraintes internationales, voire très locales comme le comité d’éthique d’un hôpital peut le demander. « Notre solution est utilisée pour développer des services mettant en œuvre des applications mobiles ou des appareils connectés, elle accélère le travail de nos clients et permet de travailler sur des fondations robustes, de leur phase de prototypage jusqu’à la mise à disposition sur le marché auprès de millions de personnes. » Les risques ? Premièrement, ce serait de ne pas exploiter la donnée alors qu’elle a beaucoup de valeur aussi bien pour l’individu, la médecine que pour la société entière. Deuxièmement, ce serait de mal l’exploiter, par exemple en biaisant le consentement ou en anonymisant les données, ce qui fait perdre le lien avec le patient. Enfin , les risques liés à la sécurité, le vol de données ou encore le piratage, existent.</p>
<p>En essor, Pryv poursuit son développement tout en nouant des partenariats avec des hébergeurs de données de santé (HDS), des sociétés de conseil en RGPD, et des sociétés qui développent des logiciels pour des clients tiers. « Notre ambition ? C’est apporter à nos clients tous les outils nécessaires pour devenir tiers de confiance dans la gestion de la vie privée de leurs clients. Leur enjeu est, à l’instar des banques qui doivent gérer l’argent selon la volonté de leurs clients, de gérer les données de l’individu selon sa volonté » conclut Pierre-Mikael Legris.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lausanne, 21 August 2018 &#8211; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv, the leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, today announced a </span><a href="https://www.rodanotech.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">milestone partnership with RodanoTech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the leading Swiss-based CRO specialised in clinical data management services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collaboration includes the development of an innovative clinical data management solution providing a comprehensive picture of each patient’s journey &#8211; one which combines patient reported outcome (PRO) data with clinical records collected by healthcare professionals. The platform is designed to meet the unique needs of the investigational research as well as the post approval market, including phase IV studies, registries and online medical communities.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><b><i>Patient relevant outcome measures</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are a proven necessity to assess the efficiency, effectiveness and personalization of clinical trials” said </span></i><b><i>Samir Mechati, CEO at RodanoTech</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “It supplements existing clinical data, increases treatment adherence and provides important insight about how patients are doing between medical visits”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The patient data set is expanding from the high-quality information collected in the clinical protocol to the more private data collated from wearables, mobile apps and in-home clinical devices. By streamlining the collection and integration of this dataset,<strong> t</strong></span><b>he joint Pryv/RodanoTech solution ensures a real-time connection with the patient health &#8211; capturing insightful data measured and influenced outside the four walls of the clinical setting.</b></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Real time, real world data that can be captured in patients’ daily lives is a powerful tool to optimise clinical research” said Pierre-Mikael Legris CEO at Pryv “</span></i><b><i>Our platform will not only capture patient data but will also give participants a view on their own trial dataset, sending a strong message of transparency and inclusivity which can turn them truly engaged</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”.</span></i></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patient consent is a critical process that has historically been highly inefficient and prone to error. <strong>The joint Pryv/RodanoTech platform optimises that additional level of security between participants and clinical trial sites. Its greatest value comes from its dynamic, fine-grained consent and re-consent capability which gives patients the trust, transparency and control they require from clinical trials.</strong> The platform logs all authorizations, including the ‘contract’ between the patient and the investigator, for compliance oversight as mandated by GCP guidelines and privacy regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RodanoTech and Pryv offer tailored solutions to conduct projects of any size, from small Phase I studies to large scale trials involving sophisticated designs and long-term follow-up across clinical settings and geographies. Our Academic offer begins with a “get started&#8221; costing for proof of principles and goes to a premium packaged solution for large scale clinical trials. </span></p>

The integration of Pryv.io is designed to meet the increasing demands from customers and regulatory body for more transparent and trustworthy management of sensitive personal information. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HealthyHealth encourages healthy behavior through algorithms and research data predicting people’s risk for medical conditions based on their lifestyle data. By using their services, people can take better care of their health, employers can nurture a healthier workforce while insurers can better engage their customers, personalise their services (offer lower premiums) and reduce liabilities.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Pryv gives us the required privacy rigour to build and maintain the trust critical for our continued success” says Etienne Bourdon, COO at HealthyHealth. &#8220;With an estimated 600’000 data points collected annually per person, we embedded a middleware technology that not only strengthens GDPR compliance but also scales our collection, use, and storage of lifestyle information.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connected health and P4 medicine (Predictive, Preventive, Personalised, Participatory) is a reality nowadays. Sensor technology, wearable devices and mobile apps are helping individuals monitor their health and alerting them to any early signs of illness. With lifestyle data, innovative players are developing value propositions that help insurers and businesses alike understand behavioural trends and score risk in a more granular way. Responsible P4 players are integrating privacy into their propositions to reinforce regulatory compliance, boost customer confidence and thereby increase engagement. Pryv.io streamlines compliance efforts and scales the process of collecting lifestyle data so that businesses can more efficiently perform risk calculations, offer personalised plans and optimise customer service.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“HealthyHealth is at the forefront of InsurTech innovation” says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv.  &#8220;Our partnership exemplifies a strong technology collaboration that unlocks the value of lifestyle data with behavioural analytics and an unwavering commitment to data privacy, protection and GDPR compliance”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.pryv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pryv</a> helps organisations manage personal data from creation, to use, to sharing and enhanced GDPR rights such as transparency, portability and right-to-be-forgotten. The API is capable of ingesting high-throughput IoT data at scale and with optimal storage density. Packaged for rapid integration, the software solution comes with a secure storage vault, encryption protocols, fine-grained consent management and comprehensive auditing capability that radically cut IT development costs and accelerate time-to-benefit while addressing most stringent data protection requirements.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HealthyHealth.uk Ltd is a company specialised in assessing precise individual health risks, with the ability to predict percentage risks for more than 800 medical conditions, hospitalisation and mortality. Using this data, a second product focuses on preventing the detected health risks by transforming digital data collected into prevention opportunities with a daily personalised plan including nutrition recommendations, physical and mental exercises. HealthyHealth is working with several (re-)Insurers, Employers and Hospitals internationally with two products : a B2B risk API for medical risk evaluation, and a B2B2C mobile App for end-users preventing detected risks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information, please <a href="mailto:contact@healthyhealth.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">send them an email</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or <a href="https://www.healthyhealth.uk/?utm_source=Referral&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Pryv%20%20Partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visit HealthyHealth website</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lausanne, Switzerland, June. 15, 2018 &#8212; Pryv, the leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, today announced a milestone partnership with </span><b>Interpolation, one of the leading IoT Platform in Asia </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(www.nocxx.com) enabling an end-to-end management of Industrial IoT solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new partnership is set to benefit customers in Japan, Thailand and the Philippines with an IoT platform-as-a-service offering meeting the highest levels of data safety, privacy and user empowerment. Both companies share vision that privacy is not an obstacle to business innovation but a competitive advantage when implemented correctly. This partnership will broaden the availability of </span><a href="https://www.pryv.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to customers in Asia Pacific and enhance the way they cope with sensitive data collection and utilization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a second phase, both companies intend to extend collaboration to Europe.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our partnership with Pryv aligns with our strategy to deliver best-of-breed IoT solutions that increase customer efficiency, productivity and quality of service&#8221; said Michiaki Satate, CEO at Interpolation. “Along our extensive experience in IoT and End-to-end solutions, we capitalize on Pryv’s expertise in data protection to design solutions that make the most of IoT connectivity while addressing markets’ strict regulation compliance, interoperability needs, and privacy concerns&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses on the leading edge of data collection and usage are realizing that they will not be able to continue their existing business model without protecting consumers&#8217; privacy. As data privacy increases in importance in Asia, Interpolation saw an opportunity to partner with one of the most rigorous privacy &amp; data protection solution provider to deploy a platform where connectivity, secure personal data storage, consent management and compliance software is combined to offer businesses a comprehensive managed privacy service that improve </span><a href="https://www.clarip.com/data-privacy/gdpr-transparency-requirements/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transparency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and user control regarding data privacy. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are pleased to welcome Interpolation to our partner network,&#8221; said Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO at Pryv &#8220;The partnership capitalizes on the unique strengths of each entity; Pryv brings the power of its rigorous Privacy software capability to one of the most established and well respected IoT technology solutions providers in Asia Pacific; Intepolation complements this by bringing the benefits of its expert services and long-term relationships with customers in Asia to Pryv.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its initial phase, the partnership will address the privacy and IoT connectivity imperatives in Industrial and healthcare sectors where service providers are looking at keeping up with evolving regulations and protecting data privacy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the key challenges of IoT data streams is to handle high volumes of data with fast connectivity without compromising on security.” says Stephan Bachofen, VP Software at Biovotion AG. “Pryv&#8217;s high throughput data ingestion will allow medical trackers to cope with future large volumes of telemetry data overcoming surges with guaranteed low-latency at affordable costs.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Healthcare industry remains among the fastest to adopt the Internet of Things. </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating IoT features into medical devices greatly improves the quality and effectiveness of service, bringing especially high value for the elderly people, patients with chronic conditions, and those requiring constant supervision. According to market estimates, spending on the Healthcare IoT solutions will reach 1 trillion Swiss francs by 2025 and will set the stage for highly personalised, accessible and on-time Healthcare services for everyone. Organisations need to ensure that future data conduits are powerful enough to handle and process the predicted throughput and increase in telemetry data, yet stay flexible enough to react to changing business needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv provides a future-proof, device-ready privacy management solution handling personal data thru its lifecycle. IoT data arrives in the form of a continuous telemetric stream, is rapidly ingested, processed for authorisation and then optimally compressed in Pryv’s personal data vault for sharing and analysis.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv&#8217;s purpose-built API is designed to ingest different types of high frequency data streams concurrently and efficiently. </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benchmarks performed on the beta release show notable improvements in throughput and storage density.<strong> On moderate virtualised hardware (4 cores, 14 GB RAM, 5000 IOPS), </strong></span><strong><a href="http://pryv.io/">Pryv.io</a> High Frequency stores 100’000 measures per second at approximately one byte per measure. The new release uses several advanced data compression algorithms to optimise disk usage. With an average IoT device capturing 20 sensor values every second, a single 4 cores  <a href="http://pryv.io/">Pryv.io</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> machine is able to store the data produced by 2000  concurrent devices.</strong> In a standard deployment, multiple machines would be receiving the telemetric streams in parallel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pryv helps organisations manage personal data from creation, to use, to sharing, archival and deletion. The High Frequency release is appropriate for health applications that require near real-time experience such as in physiology monitoring, critical home care services or point-of-care diagnostic. Our adaptive privacy out-of-box solution comes integrated with a secure storage vault, fine-grained consent management and comprehensive auditing capability that radical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ly accelerate time-to-benefit while addressing most stringent data protection requirements.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For better ageing.</p>
<p>Seniors are more susceptible to chronic conditions, which necessitate long-term treatments and numerous check-ups. The negative impact this has on patients’ quality of life can be alleviated by collaborations between caring institutions, ICT companies and researchers.</p>
<ul>
<li>How can we encourage and fast-track these collaborations?</li>
<li>What are the key elements to ensure their funding and success?</li>
<li>What is the best-fitting business model?</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding the needs of the ageing population can prove challenging, as older people are not usually the focus of marketing studies.</p>
<p>However, the development of Big Data analysis, the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence could provide researchers and innovators with meaningful information about the needs of seniors and their use of healthy ageing products.</p>
<p>Covering the needs and demands of seniors over 50, the Silver Economy covers many products and services using very different technologies, including home automation, sensors and connected objects.</p>
<p>How to sponsor the design of such a system?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s learn together and explore further the specialised venture emerging in healthy ageing?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are glad to announce Pryv was selected by FIT to benefit from the <em>early</em> loan, provided for the growth of selected companies.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>CHF 400&#8217;000 for Pryv</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Foundation for Technological Innovation (FIT) has granted an <em>early</em> loan of CHF 400&#8217;000 to the EPFL startup Pryv and its innovative eHealth and personal data management solution. early loans target young companies in phase of commercial development and looking for funds with private investors. Companies need to be based in the Canton of Vaud. With this new loan, which adds up to the 195 other loans given to innovative projects since 1994, the FIT carries on its mission to support technologically advanced startups in western Switzerland. Other condition, the selected projects need to have a collaboration with a university or a School of higher education in western Switzerland.</p>
<h4><strong>Pryv: Compliant and comprehensive management of personal and health data in the digital era</strong></h4>
<p>The digital revolution has hit many domains today, some of which are still very sensitive in terms of security and privacy, such as in healthcare. This is why eHealth, which combines life science, medicine and IT technologies, needs more secure and efficient patient data management solutions. The revolution is on thanks to the EPFL startup Pryv. It developed a software with a novel data model and dynamic consent management that ensures the availability as well as the compliant usage of sensitive data. It enables health actors (such as pharma, hospitals or insurances) to deploy their own data management systems fast, and ensure that all applicable industry and data privacy regulations are respected. Other revolution: the digital solution of Pryv puts the patient at the center of the system, where he or she can manage his or her own personal data bank.</p>
<p>Standing for privacy, Pryv and its product Pryv.io should see the birth and the growth of interdisciplinary and cross-borders projects, where sensitive, health and personal data will be collected, stored and shared without confidentiality threats, with the control of patients. Today at a crucial phase of its development, Pryv was able to confirm its commercial model introduced in 2015, validated and based on years of firsthand research, market analysis and product development, which started in 2012. The startup raised CHF 1.1 million in October 2017. The CHF 400&#8217;000 worth early loan from the FIT will help the young company grow steadily as well as secure treasury for the delivery of important orders in a field where sales cycles are rather long, before the next planned financing round in series A.</p>
<p>Contact: Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO Pryv | office@pryv.com</p>
<h4><strong>About the FIT</strong></h4>
<p>Created in 1994, the Foundation for Technological Innovation has financed innovative technological projects and startups with 30 million Swiss francs of loans and grants, in total. It provided 195 loans to 161 innovative companies, out of which 150 are still in activity today. These companies have created more than 1000 jobs in total. Innovaud, promoting innovation in the Canton of Vaud, closely collaborates with the FIT in the projects’ pre-selection process, as well as by providing support to the projects’ teams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lausanne, Jan 22, 2018 — Pryv, the leading provider of privacy and personal data management software, today announced an R&amp;D collaboration with&nbsp;the eHealth unit of HES-SO Valais- Wallis in Sierre (University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland), to automate semantization of healthcare data for effective discovery and&nbsp;exchange across the patient’s continuum of care. The initiative aims to build (up) a common vocabulary and taxonomy that will pave the way for accurate&nbsp;and reliable data communication that can rationalize disparate Electronic Healthcare Records, augment the health level 7 (HL7) series of standards and ensure meaningful use of patient data.</p>
<blockquote><p>“One of the main technology barrier for providing patient-centered healthcare is the problem that patient data is often housed in a&nbsp;number of disparate systems across multiple locations” says Professor Michael Schumacher. “We joined forces with Pryv to include rich semantics in the data model and automate the import of&nbsp;datasets to close communication gaps.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Semantization provides interoperability at the highest level in the electronic exchange of patient information among caregivers&nbsp;and other authorized parties. This improves quality, safety, efficiency and efficacy of healthcare delivery.&nbsp;When correctly implemented,&nbsp;EHR interoperability ensures that providers understand the patient as an individual with a medical history and network. Its objective is to address the challenges of how healthcare systems inform various stakeholders involved in a patient’s care as well as&nbsp;how organizational facets of health information exchange will coordinate together for the benefit of patients.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The inclusion of rich semantics into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pryv.com/">Pryv.io</a>&nbsp;goes beyond the traditional tagging and key word classification” says Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO of Pryv. “The&nbsp;eHealth unit of HES-SO Valais-Wallis is helping us to incorporate algorithms from machine learning and rule inferencing that can progressively learn the type and variety of data,&nbsp;and propose/assign explicit semantics as it flows through our software.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Alongside of the R&amp;D collaboration, HES-SO Valais Wallis is making the&nbsp;<a href="http://pryv.io/">Pryv.io</a>&nbsp;personal data management platform available to its 2’500 students and staff&nbsp;members. The environment is designed to accelerate digital health innovation and enable eHealth research projects such as an m-health self-monitoring&nbsp;solution for patients undergoing physiotherapy treatments.</p>
<p><strong>About Pryv</strong></p>
<p>Pryv&nbsp;makes essential software for data-driven healthcare&nbsp;innovation. Our purpose-built middleware helps&nbsp;organizations manage personal&nbsp;data from creation to&nbsp;use, sharing and disposal. We accelerate time to market,&nbsp;cut IT development costs and speed up connectivity to&nbsp;all data sources.&nbsp;Pryv addresses the&nbsp;enhanced citizen’s&nbsp;right under GDPR and turns privacy compliance into a&nbsp;competitive advantage.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lausanne – Switzerland and Tallinn-Estonia, 22.11.2017.</p>
<p><a href="https://cyber.ee/en/">Cybernetica AS</a>, a leading information security company and Pryv SA, a Swiss expert and provider of privacy and data management solutions, today announced the result of their joint research and collaboration started earlier in 2017. The availability of an integration between the two technologies showcase how to perform a controlled safe analysis of personal data in a complex and highly regulated environment, such as the healthcare industry.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/static/Cybernetica-Pryv.pdf">The proposed privacy-by- design solution</a> resolves the challenge of medical data sharing , including integrated compliance with complex regulations and re-using shared sensitive personal data.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“We want to provide the best privacy for the users and the best utility for data collectors. Together, Pryv and Sharemind provide a</p>
<p>healthcare data solution that gives users control over their data and secures the analysis and re-use of collected databases.“ stated the</p>
<p>management teams of Pryv SA and Cybernetica AS.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Swiss-made technology of Pryv, pryv.io provides a scalable platform for handling sensitive data in a compliant way. Pryv.io’s unique data ontology helps app developers build healthcare apps by making consent management segmentation understandable to both patients and data users. Sharemind, one of the latest breakthroughs from Cybernetica’s R&amp;amp;D team, is an application server that processes information without seeing a single value. Apps running on Sharemind collect data in encrypted form and analyse them without removing the protection. Sharemind computes analysis results directly in an encrypted form and returns them to the analyst who can decrypt them.</p>
<p><strong>The first two proof-of- concept for the business application of the combined technologies are “using mobile phone location data in </strong><strong>lifestyle analysis” and “researching relations of nutrition and diabetes”.</strong></p>
<p>The cooperation between the two companies and the validation of the technology match validates that the combination of two can solve multiple challenges for the data research, medtech, pharma and insurance sectors by enabling them to perform a controlled safe analysis of personal data, without breaking the industry regulations, privacy laws and rights of individuals.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">About Cybernetica:</span></p>

<p>Benefiting from the ready-to-be used Middleware solution of Pryv, Pharmaceutical and Life Science companies can focus now primarily on their research and deliver real benefits to patients while being sure the data management is done right under their control.</p>
<p><strong>The blockchain technology Pryv developed</strong>, and implemented in its Middleware is used to validate data set genuineness through its full life-cycle and provide a data trail audit, while the unique data ontology allows for granular data distribution to each stakeholder respecting Ethical, Legal and Clinical Data Requirements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pryv was selected to join Microsoft’s BizSpark Plus Program and benefits from $ 120,000 Microsoft Azure credit over two years.</p>
<p>This award fits perfectly the execution of Pryv Growth Strategy.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, Pryv already developed, validated and commercialized its product, pryv.io, which is used by Medtech, Pharma, Insurances and Hospitals for the development of data-driven innovative products.</p>
<p>Digital Technologies are changing the landscape of Healthcare and the market shows exponential growth with opportunities for Pryv to internationalize and scale-up in different markets.</p>
<p>Ilia Kebets, Product Manager at Pryv, explains that the decision for collaboration with Microsoft came on first place because “<b><i>Having a deployment running on Azure globally distributed data centres, is definitely a great show-case of Pryv.io capacity which enables Pryv customers to use a single provider for developing various products which can be operated in more than 34 regions around the world</i></b><b>”</b>.</p>
<p>Pryv’s technology key advantage is the compatibility to meet very diverse IT, ethical and legal requirements for personal, sensitive, medical and clinical data management.</p>
<p>Targeting the healthcare sector, Pryv’s focus is solving technology diversification, approaching the IT and Regulatory requirements associated with sensitive, health and private data collection and management while respecting local regulations and international cross-industry standards and preserving Data Security and Privacy.</p>
<p>“<i>Pryv is created with the ambition to develop and promote a technology solution which is to be used for the design of patient-centric healthcare products, where the personal and real-world data have a crucial impact on the personalized care and treatments</i>.” said Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO and co-founder of Pryv.</p>
<p>Following its company’s values, the team of Pryv always work by serving their customer-interests first. Thus, the collaboration with Microsoft and its program BizSpark Plus will “c<i>ertainly comfort our customers on their capabilities to run pryv.io Middleware solutions deployed on Azure</i>.“ said Hubert Ridolphi Chief Sales Officer at Pryv.</p>
<p>“<i>We also proved that by applying our winning cross-industry approach, which enables heterogeneous data acquisition and logic to be applied for outlining the meaningful data- patterns, brings unlimited outcomes and great cost-savings for the entire ecosystem. Managing very sensitive and personal data pushes us in the direction of preserving Ethics, Data Privacy and Security First. The combination of Pryv Vision&#8217;s assets brings to our customers confidence in the development of Personalized healthcare solutions to enhance Better care and Quality of Life</i>.” completes Evelina Georgieva, Chief Business Development Officer and Founding member of Pryv.</p>
<p>Pryv’s team has already started the execution of Pryv Growth Strategy, having pryv.io as the crucial element for the development of next level, data-centric healthcare products. Pryv works with companies across the entire ecosystem and will leverage on that in order to have <b>pryv.io set-up as an industry standard by 2022.</b></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pierre-Mikael Legris as a patient representative and co-founder of Pryv SA will participate to the Symposium  &#8220;Le dossier électronique du patient dans la pratique : quels seront les changements au quotidien?&#8221; which will be held on Tuesday 6 December 2016, 9:00 &#8211; 12:50, at the Headquarters of the Swiss Post Wankdorfallee 4, Berne</p>
<p>From a patient perspective, Pierre-Mikael will address and present the opportunities and challenges associated with the  EPD.</p>
<p>The full event information is available here: <a href="https://www.pryv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/publichealth-flyer-edp-fr-data-privacy-management-pryv.pdf">publichealth_flyer_edp_fr</a></p>
<h3>Intro: Le dossier électronique du patient dans la pratique :quels seront les changements au quotidien ?</h3>
<p>The focus of the event is the upcoming in 2017 Federal Act for the Electronic Patient Records. Each citizen who is affiliated with the health insurance in Switzerland will now have the possibility to consult his medical data anywhere and at any time. The patient&#8217;s record may contain, for example, reports, laboratory data or X-rays. It is the patients who decide which data will be recorded and what taccess to this data will be given (who, when, which).</p>
<p>During this Symposium, several months before the introduction of the electronic patient record, Public Health Switzerland would like to inform about the current state of implementation, with a focus on public health.</p>
<p>It would be discussed if the easy and quick access to medical data will result in more effective, safer and better treatments, and what would be the changes that hospitals and medical practices must prepare.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the discussion will focus on patients, who will have direct access to their medical data, and the important role that the media will play in introducing the patient&#8217;s electronic record.</p>

<p>Incorporated in 2012, Pryv is an independent swiss company, funded by a private wealth.</p>
<p>We developed and sell licenses of a market and technology-proven eHealth Middleware which allows for the cost and time-effective deployment of any eHealth, mHealth and innovative Pharma/Medtech project that involves medical or sensitive data collection and/or usage.</p>
<p>Since early 2015, we have been working with the innovation departments of Medtech, Pharma and Research organisations providing them a tool to enable any heterogenous data collection, interoperable structure, compliant data storage distributed in multiple countries and a granular level of data distribution to different stakeholders.</p>
<p>The flexibility of pryv.io being compatible with any legal and technical standards and requirements allows our customers to deploy their products on an international level.</p>

<div id="content-area">
<p><em><span style="color: #333333;">Perhaps the most exciting outcome from the revolution in mobility and the Internet of Things (IoT) is the effect both are having on healthcare. From the simplest apps and ‘wearables’ tracking exercise and diet to the remote monitoring of patients, the potential benefits are immense.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #333333;">The earliest use cases focused on delivering medical advice via mobile phones to far-flung outposts in the Philippines and Indonesia, in some cases even extending to remote surgery being carried out. Today we are seeing more and more mass-market uses being envisaged to help control the rising cost of healthcare, particularly for the aged.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #333333;">Over the past few years, a number of communications service providers (CSPs) and suppliers have been involved in TM Forum’s Digital Health Catalyst project, which aims to explore the ways they can collaborate with healthcare stakeholders to improve the end-user healthcare experience.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #333333;">Catalysts are rapid-fire, member-driven proof-of-concept projects which both inform and leverage TM Forum best practices and standards, connecting service providers, technology suppliers, and global enterprises to create innovative solutions to common industry challenges.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #333333;">The first use case developed in the Digital Health Catalyst project revolved around care at home – making sure that customers and healthcare providers could ensure quality of care by using IoT principles to better connect patients, their families, healthcare providers, insurance companies, government health agencies, and other stakeholders. The second phase expanded on this concept, leveraging data from connected devices to assess patient wellbeing and combat senior loneliness without intrusion into the patient’s life.</span></em></p>
<h5><em><span style="color: #333333;">TRULY MOBILE HEALTHCARE</span></em></h5>
<p><em><span style="color: #333333;">The latest phase, termed <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.tmforum.org/collaboration/catalyst-program/current-catalysts/#tab3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connected Care Anywhere</a>, expands the scope of digital health services even further because healthcare isn’t just required in the home or hospital. Patients, healthcare and insurance providers, and other stakeholders need to be able to deliver the same quality of care even when the patient is out and about.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #333333;">There are two main roles in a <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.tmforum.org/collaboration/catalyst-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Catalyst</a> – champions (usually an organization seeking a solution to problem) and participants (organizations contributing to solving the problem). Verizon and Orange are the champions here, partnering with Ericsson (providing its <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.ericsson.com/ourportfolio/telecom-operators/service-innovation-framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Service Innovation Framework</a>); <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.basen.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BaseN</a> (developers of scalable, inherently distributed and fault-tolerant IoT and <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spime</a> platforms); <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://www.detecon.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Detecon</a> (a leading management consulting company) and <a style="color: #333333;" href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pryv</a> (experts in patient data privacy) as participants.

<p>Montant recherché : 1,6 millions de francs</p>
<p>De la balance de votre salle de bain aux pacemakers, les dispositifs médicaux produisent quantité de données hétérogènes et donc difficiles à intégrer en dépit que cela améliorerait les diagnostics et la personnalisation des thérapies. Pryv a développé une plateforme qui collecte, conserve et distribue ces données tout en respectant les législations et la vie privée. La pharma  s’y intéresse pour ses essais cliniques et les medtechs pour lesquels c’est une base pour construire des applications de e-santé.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Qu’est-ce qu’une donnée et comment la sécuriser? Chefs d’entreprise et spécialistes de cybersécurité ont apporté des réponses à cet enjeu phare pour l’avenir des PME suisses, mercredi 4 novembre lors de la soirée organisée par Innovaud durant la CyberSec Conference, à Y-Parc (Yverdon).</strong></strong></p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Comment gérer une base de données?</strong></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>&#8220;Concrètement, l’une des clés pour garantir la sécurité de données clients reste «de savoir dans quels serveurs ces dernières sont stockées, physiquement, et de se garder le droit de les déplacer», souligne Pierre-Mikael Legris, cofondateur et CEO de Pryv, entreprise de gestion de données médicales à Lausanne. Et pour pouvoir utiliser du «data» dans des cadres juridiques multiples et en pleine évolution, il est aussi essentiel «de garder le lien entre la donnée et la personne, ce qui permet de toujours poser, in fine, la question à cette dernière quand à la réutilisation de l’information», explique le jeune chef d’entreprise.&#8221;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 180px;">For the latest edition of the Swiss Medtech Industry Magazine,  Pryv CEO, Pierre-Mikael Legris, exposed how Pryv can support Medtech, eHealth and Pharma companies to enter the space of digital healthcare faster with limited development costs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 180px;">Technical challenges such as enabling technical interoperability, standards compliances and standardization of heterogeneous data are solved by Pryv via using innovative ontology for data collection and structuring respecting data privacy and security.</p>
<p>Furthermore,  to meet the legal and compliances regulations requirements for sensitive personal and health data management, the ownership of the data is defined at a granular level which enables patients, medical doctors, Pharma companies, CROs and hospitals to easy transfer health records, medical and clinical data easily and securely, in real-time.</p>
<p>Additional capabilities of Pryv eHealth Middleware, <em>pryv.io,</em> are:</p>
<p>&#8211; secondary usage of data- valuable for clinical studies and early detection of diseases via patterns monitoring</p>
<p>&#8211; data contextualization of unlimited data sets- critical for the personalised drug development and treatment</p>
<p>&#8211; compliances adaptability- mandatory for multiple market products and services distribution</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Portrait d’entreprise rédigé par <a href="https://twitter.com/philipmaguire1">Philip Maguire</a>, Alp ICT</em></p>
<p><strong>Comme beaucoup d’autres domaines, le monde de la santé helvétique se trouve profondément bouleversé par le digital. La cybersanté explose et l’arrivée d’applications et autres appareils connectés promet l’émergence d’une nouvelle génération de patients numériques, qui bénéficieront de meilleurs services et d’une médecine plus flexible et adaptée à leurs besoins. De nombreux défis restent cependant à relever, tels que les questions réglementaires, l’interopérabilité et surtout la sécurisation des données et le respect de la vie privée. C’est la tâche à laquelle s’attelle Pryv, basé à l’EPFL Innovation Park et spécialisé dans l’E-santé.</strong></p>
<p>C’est en traversant une phase délicate de sa vie, soit l’épreuve de la maladie et de l’hospitalisation, que Pierre Mikael Legris a compris l’importance de la collecte de données de santé hors cadre hospitalier. Souffrant d’une leucémie, celui-ci doit en effet passer beaucoup de temps à l’hôpital. Ce qui n’était en fait pas forcément nécessaire : « J’ai réalisé qu’au bout d’un moment les médecins me gardaient beaucoup pour quelques mesures, mais qu’au final je pourrais tout aussi bien le faire depuis chez moi ».</p>
<p>Au départ, tout est noté dans un carnet et envoyé ensuite par email aux médecins qui le suivent, ce qui posait certains problèmes d’ordre pratique et présentait des risques, au niveau de la protection des données notamment : « J’ai compris que tout cela devait être systématisé » ajoute le CEO de la start-up lausannoise. Fondée en 2012, Pryv SA distribue aujourd’hui Pryv.io un « E-Health middleware » sous forme de licences.</p>
<p>Plus concrètement, le logiciel de Pryv est destiné aux sociétés qui ont besoin de développer leur propre solution cloud pour collecter et stocker des données médicales et personnelles. Il permet de créer des plateformes qui utilisent par exemple des objets connectés, tout en étant en conformité avec les standards du secteur et en s’assurant que seuls les personnes et services autorisés pourront avoir accès à ces informations en respectant la sphère privée du patient.</p>
<p>Basée sur une structuration unique, la plateforme peut récolter et distribuer une foule de données différentes en temps réel, tel que le taux de sucre dans le sang, essentiel dans le cas de malades souffrant du diabète. Combinées avec l’activité mesurée par des montres connectées et des photos des repas, ces informations ouvrent la porte de la médecine personnalisée et du traitement par des algorithmes spécialisés.</p>
<p>De plus, avec l’essor de l’ « internet of things », des données collectées par le patient lui-même pourront être automatiquement ajoutées à son dossier médical, une possibilité de contribution qui sera d’ailleurs réglementée par une loi fédérale dès 2017. Le monde des essais clinique pourrait également être totalement transformé par une telle innovation, en évitant de nombreuses saisies manuelles et en permettant leur traitement en temps réel.</p>
<p>En recherche de partenaires financiers, Pryv est déjà établi sur plusieurs projets : « Nous travaillons par exemple avec Domosafety, spécialiste des objets connectés au service du maintien à domicile des personnes âgées. Notre plateforme est par exemple utilisée lorsqu’ils souhaitent ajouter un appareil de contrôle ou inclure des membres de la famille dans la boucle d’information. Nous permettons à des projets eHealth de disposer d’une plateforme personnelle, prête à l’emploi, dès la phase de prototypage. », conclut-il.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8221; BMI is only marginally recognised in Switzerland, unlike in many other countries, including the USA. Recent major changes, however, such as the future federal law on electronic patient records, the personalised health initiative or the growing empowerment of citizens towards their health data are adding weight to the need for BMI capacity-building in Switzerland.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, a new federal law regulating the shared electronic patient record is currently being discussed at the political level. This law promotes the use of electronic health services, eHealth and, in particular, the rollout of electronic patient records. Implementation of the electronic patient record is expected to improve patient safety and increase in the efficiency of the healthcare system, while empowering patients. The law will introduce mandatory use of the electronic health record for inpatients with some limited financial incentives.&#8221;</p>

Currently, 36 percent of medical office professionals lack vital understanding of HIPAA&#8217;s regulations, with an additional 33 percent failing to comprehend the audit strategies that are being implemented by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&#8217; Office for Civil Rights. Audits are still rolling out, and organizations that legally must remain HIPAA compliant are opening themselves up to massive fines. The maximum HIPAA fines have increased to $50,000 per violation, capping at $1.5 million. To protect patient information and avoid financial fines, medical practices need to ensure their security measures and employees are up-to-date on HIPAA’s changes.”</p>

PAR <a href="http://www.bilan.ch/author-import/fabrice-delaye">FABRICE DELAYE</a> <strong>Plusieurs start-up suisses font de la protection de la vie privée une expérience utilisateur attrayante.</strong></p>
<p>DONNÉES PERSONNELLES</p>
<p>Depuis de nombreuses années, on répète que les lois helvétiques sur la protection de la vie privée sont un atout dans la nouvelle économie numérique. Les révélations de l’affaire Snowden sur la surveillance des données personnelles, l’arrivée des objets connectés et du soi quantifié et les applications pour smartphone qui nous géolocalisent à tout instant ont rendu la question tangible pour un large public.</p>
<p>Reste qu’à l’exception de la transformation de quelques bunkers de l’armée en data centers, le business suisse de la protection de la vie privée et des données demeurait abstrait pour l’utilisateur lambda. C’est ce qu’a décidé de changer une poignée de start-up.</p>
<p>Privately dans le contrôle d’accès aux données que l’on publie sur les réseaux sociaux, Pryv pour celui des données médicales, Threema avec sa messagerie instantanée encryptée et ProtonMail avec ses e-mails entièrement sécurisés donnent aux utilisateurs des moyens simples et efficaces de protéger leurs données personnelles des grandes oreilles de la NSA comme de Google et consorts. En substance, non seulement elles conservent les données sur des serveurs basés en Suisse mais elles démocratisent des outils sophistiqués d’encryptions. Ils sont invisibles dans l’expérience utilisateur.</p>
<h2>Naissance d’un cluster</h2>
<p>Spin-off du groupe Kudelski, Privately vient ainsi de lancer une application qui rend les données (les photos, par exemple) publiées sur Facebook et Twitter accessibles uniquement à des destinataires et pour des durées choisis. Il suffit de les télécharger sur l’app qui les publie ensuite sur les réseaux sociaux avec ces paramètres. La lausannoise Pryv commercialise, elle, sa technologie certifiée en marque blanche pour des partenaires dans le domaine de la santé.</p>
<p>A l’instar de Domosafety, ils en font une fonctionnalité de leurs produits. Threema, de son côté, fait un carton en Allemagne avec une messagerie de type WhatsApp entièrement encryptée et utilisée par 3,2  millions de personnes. La genevoise ProtonMail s’apprête à lancer sa boîte mail, elle aussi encryptée, après avoir attiré plus de 300 000 utilisateurs pour la version test. Grâce à une prise en compte soignée de l’expérience utilisateur, ces entreprises concrétisent les promesses d’un cluster helvétique dans la «privacy».</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 2em; line-height: 1.5em;">MEET THE COMPANIES DESTROYING SOFTWARE SUITES AND SYSTEM INTEGRATION AS WE KNOW IT</span></p>
<div>
<div id="ctl00_PlaceHolderMain_ctl03__ControlWrapper_RichHtmlField">
<h2>CLOUD CONNECTORS AND THEIR SURROUNDING ECOSYSTEM PROMISES A NEW, FLEXIBLE APPROACH TO CREATING BEST-OF-BREED SOFTWARE AND APPLICATION SOLUTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES ALIKE. THE APPROACH MIGHT SPELL THE END OF SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND SOFTWARE SUITES, AS WE KNOW THEM. MEET THREE OF THE SPECIALISTS WHO GIVE YOU THE INSIDE VIEW, OF WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW – AND WHAT THE FUTURE OF CLOUD CONNECTORS MIGHT BE.</h2>
<div><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=246926&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=fzQj&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah2&amp;trkInfo=idx:1-1-1%2ctarId:1423502247829%2ctas:jakob+sand">By Jakob Sand, leader of Global TMT M&amp;A team</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>Cloud integrators are currently causing upheaval in the software and application industry. The integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) approach, as it is known, lets you combine applications and software solutions seamlessly.It is an approach based on creating flexible best-of-breed solutions across the board for both individuals and companies that – wanting to or not – throws down the gauntlet and will have software giants, who want to sell you bundled software, scratching their heads, if not biting their fingernails.</div>
<div>Because while it might not be for everyone, the LEGO-based approach to software solutions, with the ability to connect apps and software from any and all developer is gaining steam and has got large parts of the software industry, as well as venture capitalists and investment funds, buzzing.</div>
<div>For example, the cloud connector IFTTT recently raised $30 million in new funding and was valued at $200+ million by VentureWire. A valuation that will no doubt grow as the company expands its network of connected applications.</div>
<div>IFTTT can connect various parts an emerging ecosystem of apps that offers everything from Facebook and Twitter to small, highly focused and specialised services.</div>
<div>As I have written about in<a href="http://bdoblog.com/techandmediawatch/Pages/IFTTT.COM-and-Zapier-get-ready-to-kill-software-giants-and-integrators-with-LEGO.aspx"> another article</a>, the degree of specialisation might mean the death of bundled software from giants such as Microsoft, Adobe and Oracle, plus have wide-ranging impacts on adjoining industries such as system integration.</div>
<div>I spoke to three insiders about their take on the cloud connector ecosystem, as well as what possibilities and challenges might lie ahead.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<h4></h4>
<h3>Jakob Sand (JKS): To start with the positives, what are some of the main strengths of cloud integrators, not just for your company but also for users in general?</h3>
<div></div>
</div>
<div>Renat Zubairov (RZ), Co-Founder &amp; CEO of elastic.io, a provider of iPaaS that helps SaaS Vendors and companies using SaaS software with data and application integration:</div>
<div>Best of breed springs to mind. Companies have much better possibilities of creating solutions tailored to their needs.</div>
<div>It makes companies more flexible and able to react faster to changes in markets or internal organisational needs. Companies’ internal IT infrastructure and efficiency gains related to it are major competitive advantages in the current competitive landscape. If all companies bought the same software that advantage would not exist.</div>
<div>Evelina Georgieva (EG), Head of Business Development at Pryv. Pryv provides personal and health logging solutions to both organizations and individuals:</div>
<div>For us as a company, the main benefit is quick and easy communication with users, and quicker access to a large number of potential users.</div>
<div>The power of our service is to a degree dependent on the amount and quality of data available and the ability to seamlessly collect and integrate data from many different apps and platforms is a plus for both us and our customers.</div>
<div>Suzanne Cohen (SC), CEO at FollowUp.cc. – a company that provides users with the ability to set time-based reminders via email through formatted email addresses in the TO, CC and BCC fields:</div>
<div>The ability to make integrations on the fly without bringing in an IT person and engineering resources. Before cloud connectors, integration was a challenging and expensive process and now it is simple.</div>
<div>If we were to build an integration, we would test the market and see if there was a need to service, look at the cost of building and then perhaps start engineering. Only after we had some validation would be build and we certainly wouldn’t put resources into building a feature for a single user. That changes with cloud integrators.</div>
<div>The fact that our tool can be integrated with many others leads to a situation where our customer stickiness is vastly improved.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<h4></h4>
<h3>JKS: How would you say that the advantages of cloud integrators might vary between SMEs and larger companies?</h3>
<div></div>
</div>
<div>EG from Pryv: There are certain advantages in regards to SMEs, due to the flexible approach. Using a cloud integration solution for your software and app needs definitely cuts your IT-costs.</div>
<div>SC from FollowUp: It eliminates integration costs &#8211; making it easier to on-board users and giving those users the features that they want almost immediately. This definitely helps speed up the sales process.</div>
<div>The size of the enterprise probably matters. The majority of our users are either SME companies or individuals.</div>
<div>RZ from elasti.io: You could argue that it is better suited for the needs of SMEs, but larger organisations see a lot of what I refer to as consumerization of software and apps. This means that individual workers, offices or departments use specific services that might not be part of the organisation’s official software ecosystem.</div>
<div>Just think about Dropbox; many workers use that or similar services to share documents – even if Dropbox is not the company’s preferred cloud storage service.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<h4></h4>
<h3>JKS: Are you afraid that your product might ‘drown’ in a sea of similar offerings in such an ecosystem? Or that cloud connectors being a new kind of software vendor and offering integration services might have an impact on your business?</h3>
<div></div>
</div>
<div>SC: I do not think we are likely to drown. What I think you will see is the emergence of a lot of specialist apps and software that only do few things, but do those things very well. There is a great strength in specialising and offering unique services, and I think that will be the future scenario: a lot of specialised products that end users can mix and match to create best of breed solutions across the board.</div>
<div>EG Our product is pretty specific and I do not think there is a similar product on a platform such as IFTTT at the moment. Of course, there might be others in future, but I do not think that it is likely that we are going to see a lot of direct competition. I agree on the specialisation, which also means that the development teams in app and software companies do not need to be very large – on a comparative scale with what you see in big companies, at least.</div>
<div>RZ: Well, if you ask system integrators, many of them will tell you that they are seeing a drop in the number of consultancy hours they do. That is not only related to the cloud integrators, but also has something to do with the general development of the software business.</div>
<div>I do not think that cloud connectors are the new system integrators, or that they even want that role.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<h3>JKS: It sounds like cloud connector could turn services into a system akin to LEGO where the individual user – be it a person, group or company – has the ability to mix and match solutions as they want.</h3>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Is this a view you would agree with? And if so, what are some of the consequences for other parts of the software industry?</h3>
</div>
<div>SC: I think some of that is already happening today. Take our own company, for example. We use intercom.io and closed.io for customer interaction and sales that would otherwise be spread out over email, chat sessions, CRM, analytics, etc. Both apps do what they do extremely well, and suit our needs perfectly. Thanks to cloud integration, we can connect and integrate these solutions.</div>
<div>However, I think there will always be a place for enterprise software. Using a cloud connector to integrate is still a challenging process for the vast majority of people. We use Zapier to automate many business processes in our office and I have been super impressed with the functionality, but my mom could never figure out the system.</div>
<div>RZ: We are seeing the emergence of a different ecosystem of apps and connections between them that relies on some of the strengths of a cloud-based approach.</div>
<div>That said, there are still some issues and challenges when implementing a decentralised software structure in a business setting. One such issue communication latency that is specific for Cloud/SaaS applications, which is one area where an on-premise applications behave differently.</div>
<div>There is also an issue of trust. It is not that people do not trust cloud integrators, but that they know and trust the system integrators they work with, and who they have easier face-to-face access to.</div>
<div>In short, I think that there will still be plenty of room for solutions like SAP, and there will be many companies who prefer the single solution approach, but cloud connectors offer a customizable, flexible, best-of-breed approach.</div>
<div>EG: The LEGO approach is definitely one that we agree with and support. It seems to lead back to how the software and app industry was a long time ago, where there was much more room for smaller companies. To some degree, cloud integrators help support an emerging ecosystem inhabited by a multitude of small, agile and highly specialised companies who keep on coming up with new products. I believe it is a model that large software and app companies cannot compete with.</div>
<h3></h3>
<div>
<h3>JKS: What are some of the mergers and acquisition trends we are seeing in relation to cloud integrators? Are we, for example, seeing big companies take on the newcomers by delving into their incredibly deep pockets?</h3>
</div>
<div>RZ: In the first wave of acquisitions in the cloud integration space we saw the Dell/Boomi and IBM/CastIron deals. These two deals are in the deep enterprise integration area where cloud has just started to play a role.</div>
<div>It is difficult to know when we might see the next big wave come, but it might be tied to the maturation of business app stores like App Direct or Parallels, which will go out and buy very specific features and capabilities.</div>
<div>SC: There is to some degree a trend where some of the bigger players are buying up some of the smaller enterprises and start-ups they find interesting, or offer specialised services that they want to integrate. For example, this is what I think was behind Microsoft’s move to acquire Acompli and Sunrise.</div>
<div>An interesting trend that I think will continue is the emergence of specialists in the ‘pipes’ themselves. Twilio is growing rapidly, and what they offer if the connection between apps or software. In other words, it does not do anything on its own of offer channels like IFTTT.</div>
<div>EG: I am sure that the big companies will want to try that, but the organic and evolving nature of the market that is made possible thanks to cloud connectors will prove that it is an approach that is doomed to fail.</div>
<div>The question becomes: how do you identify the small companies that are going to be successful, the ones that might become a threat to part of your bundled software-solutions or offer a new, innovative solution that corners a specific market? I do not think that will be possible. It would be like trying to keep track of a continually growing long tail of apps and software.</div>
<div>For the smaller companies, the cloud connectors helps them reach a number of users where they become interesting for VCs and investment funds.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Artikel erschienen in IT Magazine 2015/01</span></p>
<div>von Christian Walter, swiss made software</div>
<div><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> </span></div>
<div><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="" src="https://d.agkn.com/pixel/2387/?ct=CH&amp;st=&amp;city=0&amp;dma=0&amp;zp=1024&amp;bw=4&amp;che=3082264767&amp;col=8595840,1288378,116131679,289151545,61898499" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">Die Verwaltung und Aufbewahrung medizinischer Daten ist heikel. Die Menge ist gross und nimmt ständig zu. Ein Treiber ist der Trend zur Selbstvermessung, das Quantified Self. Ins Spiel kommen hier allerlei neue Sensoren und Wearables. Diese produzieren nicht nur viele Daten, sondern legen diese in unterschiedlichsten Silos auf verschiedene Arten ab. So entstehen disparate Datenberge, verteilt rund um den Erdball. Ordnung in dieses digitale Tohuwabohu bringen will das Lausanner Start-up Pryv.<br />
Seit Oktober 2014 bietet das Unternehmen eine Datenverwaltungslösung für Businesskunden. Deren Entwicklung begann bereits 2012. Damals wollten die sechs Gründer aus dem EPFL-Umfeld eine Endkunden-Lösung schaffen, die ihnen die Kontrolle über die eigenen Daten ermöglicht. Dafür schufen sie einen ganzen Software-Stack. Allerdings gelang es nicht, die notwendigen Gelder zu akquirieren, um das Frontend fertigzustellen. Aus der Not wurde eine Tugend und Pryv änderte die Zielkundschaft von Privat auf Business.</div>
<div></div>
<h2>Wearables und andere Sensoren</h2>
<div></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">Schliesslich war das grundlegende Problem auch hier vorhanden. Zahlreiche Geschäftsideen fussen auf der Erhebung von Daten mittels sogenannter Wearables oder anderer Sensoren, deren Speicherung und schliesslich Verarbeitung. Hier setzt Pryv in seiner zweiten Inkarnation an, zum Beispiel bei der Altenpflege. Ein Kunde des Unternehmens ist spezialisiert auf Notfallerkennung bei allein lebenden Senioren. Deren Wohnungen werden mit Sensoren an Türen, Kühlschränken oder Couch und Bett ausgestattet. Die Interaktion der Menschen mit den Sensoren wird aufgezeichnet und nach einer Weile können Anomalien erkannt und gegebenenfalls Notfalldienste alarmiert werden.<br />
Sensoren und Analyse obliegen Pryvs Kunden, setzen aber auf der Pryv-Datenbank auf. Diese wird direkt von den selbstentwickelten Sensoren des Partners gefüttert, kann aber auch mit fast allen anderen gängigen Marken sprechen. «Im letzten Jahr erkannte man in der Wearables-Industrie, dass es ohne offene APIs nicht geht. In Folge sind praktisch alle APIs offengelegt worden», so Pierre-Mikael Legris, CEO von Pryv.</div>
<div itemprop="articleBody"></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">
<h2>Endkunden haben Kontrolle</h2>
<div>
<div id="div-gpt-ad-1332858828538-4">
<div id="google_ads_iframe_/95676218/ITM.ch_Rectangle3_Artikel_content_0__container__"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Zwischen Sensor, App (viele Sensoren sprechen nur mit Handys) und Datenbank muss ausserdem keine weitere Software für Übersetzung und Authentifizierung sorgen. Pryv hat bereits entsprechende Libraries an Bord. Ausserdem verfügt die Software über eine Logik, welche die übermittelten Daten immer auf dieselbe Weise im Backend ablegt – ganz egal, wie die Erfassung funktioniert hat. So kann das Fabrikat der Sensoren jederzeit gewechselt werden, beziehungsweise können auch Daten aus anderen Quellen ohne Probleme integriert werden. Das ist auch von Vorteil, wenn man über die Landesgrenzen hinweg aktiv sein möchte, denn gesetzliche Rahmenbedingungen spielen hier eine wichtige Rolle. So werden Daten auch geographisch nur in Jurisdiktionen gespeichert, in denen sie lagern dürfen, beziehungsweise nur Daten zusammengeführt, die man kombinieren darf. </span></div>
</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">Interessanterweise darf hier auch der Patient mitreden – sofern der Anbieter dies erlaubt. Ein mögliches Szenario ist die Weitergabe der Sensordaten an Dritte, zum Beispiel Familienangehörige. Diese können direkt einsehen, ob es irgendwelche Unregelmässigkeiten gibt oder ob man lieber später anruft, da der Senior noch im Bett liegt. Das ist zwar löblich, aber nicht im Interesse eines jeden Menschen, auch wenn er gebrechlich ist. Deshalb kann dieser bestimmen, wie genau die Aussagen sind. Das Spektrum reicht hier von «Alles in Ordnung» bis «Macht gerade die Kühlschranktür auf». Die Berechtigung vergibt der Senior selbst mit einem eigenen Token.<br />
Das Anwendungsspektrum ist natürlich deutlich weiter und Pryv hat schon andere Projekte in Arbeit.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few months, we have been getting hints of opportunities in using the Pryv platform for businesses, particularly in the health sector where its privacy-first, user-centered design makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>At the same time, we came to acknowledge that we would not be able to develop our user product as initially expected. To achieve our ambitions and launch a full-featured offer, we need significantly more resources that are still missing so far.</p>
<p>We thus decided to adjust our strategy, and focus on providing Pryv as a platform and service to health organisations.</p>
<p>Importantly, pursuing this new business opportunity will allow us to continue supporting and evolving Pryv for our users. The Pryv service will continue to run, with registration open to everyone, and in a couple of weeks we&#8217;ll publish updates to both our web and iOS apps.</p>
<p>We look forward to what this change will bring for Pryv and its users, and are currently looking for more business partners. <a href="/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more about our offer to businesses here.</a></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the day of the diagnosis, I was in bed in an “isolation room” in the urgent care department at Cantonal Hospital of Lausanne. I was transferred there from Morges the day before because my immunity was so low that I needed a sterile environment. My small room was no larger than a cubicle, and my wife, Amandine, sat by my side. Only one person was allowed to visit me at a time. When my mother arrived, my wife had to leave.</p>
<p><a id="1228"></a>A group of doctors entered the room. I was alone with them, crowded in the cubicle. They had performed a biopsy on my hip. The results were clear, they told me. My bone marrow is overloaded with tumor cells. There was no longer any doubt. I had leukemia. The doctors asked me if I understood what they were saying. I told them I did, and asked some necessary questions. They told me that I would undergo chemotherapy as soon as possible.</p>
<p><a id="0626"></a>I called my wife back inside when the doctors left. I said nothing but the word, “leukemia.” Amandine is a nurse, so she needed no explanation. She took me in her arms, crying silently. We didn’t speak much. I told her what the doctors said. And we sat in silence.</p>
<p><a id="0bfb"></a>Soon, the weight of my illness fell heavy on my mind. Amandine and I were just five months married. She was pregnant. Now I had brought this upon her, and upon our child. All of our dreams and hopes were now caught in a storm. Facing down leukemia became my focus. We would do this together. There was no other option.</p>
<p><a id="48fa"></a>A few weeks before my diagnosis, I was working like a dog. I led a small start-up team building software to compare banking fees. I was a fresh graduate with a computer science degree. I was passionate about starting and building projects. I went to the doctor at the urging of my osteopath. I had complained of back pain so intense that I spent some work days lying on the floor. In the next few days I saw the doctor every day. He conducted a battery of tests, and the ordeal left me more and more tired. My skin and eyes became yellow, and we suspected it was a strange case of jaundice. Amandine and I made fun of it and took pictures. We never imagined that it would be leukemia. The thought was crazy.</p>
<p><a id="7ffc"></a>But that’s what it was. And there was no turning back. The cancer forced me to realize my mortality. I was fragile. I was weak. And now I had to summon the strength not to die.</p>
<p><a id="6c94"></a>Over the next 6 years, I received a bone marrow graft, and focused on fighting toward recovery. I wanted so badly to keep control over myself and my body. I remember waking up in the middle of the night with a strange awareness of my body. I started speaking to it, to my blood, to my muscles, to all my cells, addressing them as troops, readying them for battle. It was a surreal experience. I felt such clarity that I truly expected something to happen, expected that I could control my body with my mind.</p>
<p><a id="67dd"></a>Another morning, I lost my mind. I woke up early, unplugged the needle from my chest, took my clothes and tried to leave the hospital. In my mind I was over everything, convinced that everything that happened to me had been the fruit of my will. I ended up in a straitjacket.</p>
<p><a id="1d00"></a>Cancer is a war. Living through it included moments of sheer horror, of immense ugliness, but this war was also my life, and life went on, with its joys and happiness too. Every horror is dimmed, thankfully, by moments of kindness, of humanity, of boredom. I took pictures of those hard times.. the radiotherapy devices, the rooms I lived in. Pictures of my face with a feeding tube in my nose. I have pictures of me naked when I weighed 56kg, bones inside pale skin. Even then I already knew that I was going to forget.</p>
<p><a id="f674"></a>Living at the hospital, undergoing chemotherapy, I began tracking my life on the doctors’ requests. They asked me to take my temperature regularly, and to note how I was feeling. Over time, by tracking and noting everything, the doctors started trusting me to live outside the hospital. Instead of them collecting the data while I stayed in isolation, I would collect the data myself. Data meant freedom, it meant I could stay home with my family. At one point or another, I’ve tracked: my temperature, my blood pressure, my glucose concentration, my emotions, my vision, my physical condition, my work time, my activities, my excretory function, and my blood analysis. I was thorough. Leukemia and its treatment were a problem for specialists to solve, but I was going to give them every bit of data I could muster.</p>
<p><a id="013d"></a>The tracking helped my doctors immensely. They were able to use the up-to-date information I provided to help me make wise decisions that have increased my quality of life and altered the path of my illness. Today, I count myself as a survivor, and I’m not done surviving. I still have to take twelve pills a day, and sometimes more in case of crisis. I still track my health and keep notes for doctor consultations. I never go far from home without my medical records. I even look at my records just to remind myself how lucky I am.</p>
<p><a id="623a"></a>Today I also track the things I like. I keep photos of my kids, the great things they do, the places I go, and I use Pryv to keep most of it. I also use Pryv to communicate with my doctors, but it’s mostly about gaining and maintaining perspective over my life. I can look back at what I’ve done, at what I’ve achieved, and it gives me strength… and dissipates my doubts. On Pryv, I track the good things and the bad, but always the things I want to remember.</p>
<p><a id="93d2"></a>Since my diagnosis, I’ve gained an exaggerated empathy for people with illness, pain and disability. Cancer didn’t teach me much. It mostly stole some of my care-free attitude, but I’m lucky that I had a lot to spare. It mostly taught me to keep asking for help. Asking for help is giving others a chance to improve themselves. I asked for love, for hope, for kindness, and my family, my friends, my doctors delivered, and together we are overcoming this disease. I look back regularly on the notepads I’ve filled with data, and they remind me that I was weak yet strong, that I am sick, yet alive. They remind me to find the wonder and joy in every morning, in every breath, in every step.</p>
<p><a id="5bd7"></a>In 2008, doctors believed that I would never father another child, but today, Amandine and I are the proud parents of four boys. And I’m tracking each one of them, from their first words to their health to their prolific artwork, and beyond. Life-logging is no longer just freedom for me, it’s also gratitude. And if you want to be happy, then gratitude, just like freedom, is essential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">SAN DIEGO, Calif., Sep. 4, 2014 &#8212; Pryv is excited to announce its partnership with Misfit Wearables, the most innovative wellness &amp; health tracking company. Misfit users may now collect, unite, explore and share their data selectively and at a glance on Pryv.</p>
<p> Pryv enables its users to connect their Misfit data with other streams from their digital life, from Twitter, Google Glass, Facebook, Evernote, and over 120 other services, all into an insightful interface. Users can choose to host their data on servers in the location of their choice, be it in the US, Switzerland, France, or Hong-Kong, for maximum privacy and control. Advanced users can also upload pictures, notes, locations, numerical values and .csv files.</p>
<p>“Our close partnership with Misfit means we can offer our users completely new insights into their digital life,” says Frederic Mauch, co-founder of Pryv. “They’ll get a customized view of how their steps affect their mood, how their performance affects the number of pics they take, and discover countless other correlations between their Misfit data and their other lifestyle streams. It’s a game-changer.”</p>
<p>“For me and many of my fellow Misfit Shine users, Pryv is the sharing solution we’ve been waiting for” says Pierre-Mikael Legris, co-founder and CTO of Pryv. “I can now selectively share a snapshot of my health data with my coach, doctor and friends. On Pryv, your data is yours, and it’s the only multi-source life-logging solution that’s HIPAA certified.”</p>
<p>Pryv is offering 2 years of service (an $80 value) to the first 1000 registered users coming through Misfit, using the following registration link:</p>

<p>5 years ago, I looked <del>crazy</del> <del>stupid</del> naive when I mentioned the idea, that in the future (which is now), telco’s will be selling disconnection as much as connection, access restriction as much full access.</p>
<p>Similarly, when I spoke at <a title="Viewpoints from ITU Telecom World 2013 by Clement Charles and other panels members" href="https://itunews.itu.int/en/4849-Viewpoints-from-ITU-Telecom-World-2013.note.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ITU last year on data privacy in World Telecom</a> in Bangkok, I mentioned the fact that selling privacy and secured data access, I remember people being really surprised in the audience. Then, later during the event, I was happy to see fellow future-thinker (Swiss too) Gerd Leonard mentioned the exact same concept when he addressed the crowd of operators and regulators telling them “telcos are in the trust business”. You can view the full keynote <a title="Trust and Ethics and the Internet: Futurist Gerd Leonhard at ITU Telecom World" href="http://vimeo.com/95018475" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Logically, in the space of personal data, especially with lifelogin and quantified self data, trust is not an option, it <del>must</del> should be a central piece of the product offering.  This is way I’ve loved the concept of Pryv from the very start, in the field of QS  meta platforms to aggregate your various data. Contained in the name (Pryv, as in private) , but also in their DNA (they’re Swiss, and as such love secrecy), their concept is really right and fair, proposed in a rich user interface.</p>
<p>Now to the business, I just discovered the business of Respect Networks, dubbed as <em>“the leading platform for secure, verified and mutually agreed sharing of personal data”</em>. This is just a start of new business, where people will pay for trust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Following this adagio Pryv is helping customers to have a healthier and happier life thanks to a better understanding of themselves. They can collect data from different sources, display them in a chronological way, cross them to develop patterns and insights to define what works better for them to fulfil their passions: if you track you can crack! Everyone is unique and what perfectly works for you doesn’t work with the same efficacy for me so if I devote a bit of time to really understand in which situations I am getting the best results when I am training, working and recovering I can define and reinforce the related positive behaviours.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My kids are now 10 and 11. As any kids that age, they do spend significant time on their ipads, iphones, PSvita, Whatsapp, Instagram…</p>
<p>They do share lots of personal stuff with their friends and they never get close to consider privacy issues, customer profiling..</p>
<p>To them, this is “normal” communication in the best possible world.  In the meantime, many companies have started collecting data on them and building a complete profile of who they are, what they say, what they like.</p>
<p>Is there anything wrong with this ? It sure is an arguable point depending on your ethics and principles.</p>
<p>My goal is to get them to understand that their data belongs to them, and what they share should be limited to whom they share it with.  I told them that this data has value and they should profit from it if anyone.</p>
<p>So they started using Pryv to collect very personal stuff, including their journal and their favorite pics. This personal stuff is shared with only a few close friends. Surely they spend most of their online time on other highly popular services but those first steps into Pryv help them grasp the concept of casual data versus personal data.</p>

<p>La Suisse va connaître une pénurie de médecins généralistes: en 2030, il en manquerait 1’800, notamment dans les régions périphériques. Or, avec l’augmentation de l’espérance de vie et les progrès médicaux, les malades chroniques qui nécessitent un traitement au long cours seront plus nombreux.Où trouveront-ils les médecins avec qui établir des relations durables? Plus largement, &#8220;Vacarme&#8221; interroge l’évolution de la relation patient-médecin.</p>
</div>
<p>Quel est la nature du lien qui se tisse entre le médecin généraliste et son patient? Entre connaissances médicales, progrès technique et relation humaine, quelle dimension le médecin doit-il privilégier? Alors que les cabinets médicaux collectifs se développent, pourra-t-on encore voir &#8220;son&#8221; médecin ?</p>
<p>&#8220;Vacarme&#8221; entre dans le cabinet des médecins, à l’écoute des patients.</p>
